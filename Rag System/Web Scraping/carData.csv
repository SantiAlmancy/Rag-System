Ferrari F10,"While some other teams were already focused on the development of their machines for the upcoming season, Ferrari was entangled in a fight for both titles until the end of the 2008 season. Usually that is not a very big problem but with the advent of a completely new set of rules and a ban on all in-season testing, this proved to be disastrous for the Italian team. Throughout 2009 the 'Scuderia' was forced to play catch-up and a single victory for Raikkonen in the Ferrari F60 was a small reward for all the effort.
With little more to win, Ferrari decided to stop development of the F60 well ahead of the final race of the season and instead turned their full attention on its successor, the F10. The single biggest revision in the regulations the engineers had to deal with was the ban on re-fueling during the race, so a much larger fuel tank had to be fitted. Considering the huge effect of changing fuel loads on the handling of the car, this was by no means a straightforward job. The designers could work with the room that became available after the removal of the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) unit; the teams had unanimously agreed to abandon engine recovery system for the foreseeable future.
One of the bigger problems of the F60 was its poor aerodynamics, so much work was done in this area as well. The nose on the F10 has some clear traits of the highly successful Red Bull design of 2009.The 'aero' element that proved most successful was the 'double diffuser' used to great effect by World Champions Brawn. Despite being a topic of much debate and protest, the 'double diffuser' remained legal for the new season. Ferrari tried to make the most of it by angling the V8 up slightly. Although this raised the centre of gravity slightly, it also created room for larger diffuser tunnels. For the same reason, the exhausts are mounted alongside the engine.
Lined up to drive the F10 is Ferrari stalwart Felipe Massa, who has recovered fully from his horrendous accident during qualifying for the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix and is joined for the first time by two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso. During the official pre-season tests, the two Ferrari drives were always at the sharp end of the time-sheets and went into the Bahrain season opener as the favourites. In qualifying the two scarlet machines were beaten only by Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull. Running second and third in the race, Alonso and Massa benefitted from a technical problem that dropped Vettel back to fourth. This allowed Alonso to lead home a Ferrari one-two on his debut for the Italian team."
Force India VJM03 Mercedes,"The Force India Formula One Team finished the 2009 season as a genuine regular contender for points and the new 2010 challenger, the VJM03, builds on the solid foundations established by its predecessor, which took pole for the Belgian GP. With driver consistency in Adrian Sutil and Tonio Liuzzi and the able support of Paul di Resta in the test and reserve driver role, this year the team is looking forward to a strong performance right from the start of the year.
'Our goal is to continue on the same path of performance improvement that we had at the end of 2009,' says chairman and team principal Dr Vijay Mallya. 'I don't think I am being over-proud when I say 2009 was an exceptional year for us. The bare statistics say it all: one podium, one pole position, one fastest lap, a further five top 10 starts and 13 points. We've learnt from our experiences and we've come out a better team: resilient, resourceful and now resurgent. I hope 2010 will see this great progress carrying forward. We've got one podium so far but I would hope that, this time next year, I'm talking about more points and more podiums. I'm confident we can get this, why not aim high?'
While the VJM03 is an evolution of last year's strong car, it incorporates the package of rules changes introduced for this year, including the requirement for a larger fuel tank as a result of the refuelling ban and a switch to narrower front tyres.
Design director Mark Smith explains, 'The VJM03 is definitely an evolution of the VJM02 in terms of the design philosophies we have developed at Force India over the last year. We are very happy with the direction, therefore we have opted to evolve the car rather than significantly revise.
'Obviously one of the major aspects we have had to contend with are regulation changes which have had a considerable impact on some aspects of the design of the car. The removal of refuelling from races increases the amount of fuel needed to be stored in the cars - almost twice the amount we ran in 2009. There is a compromise now: either make the car much longer or wider, or, as we have done, a combination of both. This of course has influenced the mechanical design solutions and also the aerodynamics, specifically with respects to the diffuser and bodywork.
'Even with the ban of double diffusers for 2011, we recognise that we still have to push as much as we possibly can in this area in 2010 as we have targets to meet and the double diffuser is a key development aspect of the car.'
Last year's VJM02 was noticeably quicker on the low downforce circuits, however Mark is confident that this year the VJM03 will be strong across the board: 'The VJM02 was a relatively low drag car that showed well on the low downforce tracks. As was demonstrated throughout 2009, that was a useful attribute but as we go into 2010 we have tried to maintain a high level of aerodynamic efficiency, but we recognise that our championship position will be enhanced by a general level of performance that is suited to all types of circuits. We have, we believe, quite an efficient car overall.'
Adrian Sutil is eagerly anticipating the start of the season, '2010 is a really important season and we are very optimistic about going well. I think this year it's important to be consistent from the first race. I'd like to be in the midfield and be competitive from Bahrain. It's the first time we have been completely on schedule so I feel this will be the first season when I can show from the beginning to the end what is possible with the car and what I can do. Of course we will have updates and performance packages from this point on but I hope we will be strong from the first practice session rather than compromising at the start.'
Meanwhile Tonio Liuzzi is also going to the season with a strong goal, 'After one and a half years in a test role, I feel really prepared, both physically and mentally for a full race season. My objective is to be as strong and consistent as possible and give good feedback to the team to help them improve. For sure scoring points as many times as I can is going to be the key and you never know, perhaps we can get something more as well if everything comes together.'
The VJM03 will make its official testing debut on 10 February at the Jerez circuit in Spain. Tonio Liuzzi will be on driving duties for the first two days before Adrian Sutil takes over on 12 February for a further two days. Paul di Resta will step into the car on 17 February in Jerez."
Lotus T127 Cosworth,"Lotus Racing unveiled its 2010 challenger, the Lotus Cosworth T127, at a glittering event in London's Royal Horticultural Hall. Team Principal Tony Fernandes was joined on stage by Chief Technical Officer Mike Gascoyne and drivers Jarno Trulli, Heikki Kovalainen and Fairuz Fauzy to take the wraps off the car in front of a 500 strong live audience.
As the lights came up the car's stunning green and yellow livery was seen for the first time, striking an emotional chord with both young and old alike and evoking memories of some of motor racing's most iconic moments in an entirely contemporary fashion.
Tony Fernandes gave his thoughts on the astonishing achievement the Lotus Racing team has accomplished in launching the car just five short months since the team was granted its entry to the FIA Formula One World Championships, saying: ""I am extremely proud to be here today and to be able to show the world the fruits of the team's hard work over the last five months. It's humbling for me and my fellow shareholders, Kamarudin Meranun and SM Nasarudin to see how a team that five months ago didn't even exist is now a thriving workforce, full of enthusiasm and passion for Lotus Racing and the challenges ahead and capable of producing such a beautiful machine in such a short time.
""Now we've achieved two major milestones; confirming our entry and unveiling our car, but now the real work starts. Next we move on to testing and the season ahead and I'm confident that the team will exceed expectations wherever we go, and will do so on a wave of support around the world that has been growing daily since we first unleashed Lotus Racing back in September '09.""
Mike Gascoyne added his thoughts, saying ""The last few months have been some of the most challenging of my career, but it's been a challenge the whole team and I have thrived on since we first started work on the car up in Norfolk. I'm delighted that we've reached this point, and now we have a beautiful car that gives us a great base to work from for the season ahead and a fighting chance of going racing in the right way, with a winning mentality. The hard part starts now, and I know everyone in the team and I are up for whatever lies ahead.""
The Lotus Racing T127 is powered by Cosworth and will use an Xtrac gearbox and, in line with all 2010 teams, will be running on Bridgestone tyres."
McLaren MP4-25 Mercedes,"After a difficult start of the season with the MP4-24, McLaren managed to score a pair of victories during the second half of the 2009 season. The British team attempted to carry on this momentum into the next year with the new MP4-25. Leaving little to chance, McLaren managed to obtain the services of the 2009 World Champion Jenson Button, who joined the 2008 champion Lewis Hamilton to form what was arguably the strongest driver line-up in the field.
What let the MP4-24 down early in its career was its poor aerodynamics. Those issues were not only sorted but McLaren also managed to introduce a revolutionary new aerodynamics device. Named the 'F-duct' after the location the intake scoop was placed in reference to a letter on the 'Vodafone' sponsor decal, it was a duct that fed air from the top of the nose to the rear wing. It was designed to 'stall' the air ahead of the wing, which improved the top speed on the straights by nearly 10 km/h. It was actuated by the driver, who could close a hole in the cockpit to actuate the system. As it was driver operated, the system did not fall foul of the ban on moveable aerodynamics devices.
Although McLaren once again used the Mercedes-Benz engine, there was a profound shift in the balance as the German manufacturer had acquired a controlling stake in the rival Brawn GP team. There were no immediate changes as McLaren remained fully works supported and received the latest specification of the 2.4-litre V8. Dubbed the FO 108X, it was limited at 18,000 rpm. It was mated to a seven-speed gearbox with seamless shifts operated by paddles behind the steering wheel. The suspension was through double wishbones at all four corners, with push-rod actuated in-board springs and dampers.
The rival teams were not particularly happy with the 'F-Duct' but after a further check during the season opener in Bahrain, the MP4-25 was cleared to race. Hamilton was immediately competitive and finished third. For the subsequent Australian Grand Prix Button qualified fourth and managed to claim the first win for the MP4-25 in only his second appearance for the team. Button would win again in China and Hamilton scored a further three victories in a very closely disputed season. Hamilton still had a mathematical chance of the World Championship but despite finishing second, ended the year fourth in the points. McLaren was second in the Constructors' Championship.
For the 2011 season, the controversial 'F-Duct' was banned and instead the similar DRS or Drag Reduction System was introduced to aid overtaking. Although different in execution, the DRS was clearly inspired by the MP4-25's infamous 'F-Duct'. With five wins in a hugely competitive season, the MP4-25 was one of the last successful McLarens before the team lost its way during the second half of the 2010s."
Mercedes-Benz W01,"At a time when the other major manufacturers announced their departure from the sport, Mercedes-Benz actually increased their presence in Formula 1; the German company acquired the highly successful Brawn GP team at the end of 2009. After serving as an engine supplier for the better part of twenty years, Mercedes-Benz would now field a complete car in 2010. Perhaps even bigger news was the signing of seven-time Michael Schumacher as one of the two drivers.
The last time a proper Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix car was raced was back in 1955. In the hands of Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss this W196 dominated Formula 1. The season was however completely overshadowed by the horrific accident at Le Mans that involved a Mercedes-Benz sports car. It took almost forty years before the Stuttgart based manufacturer returned as an engine supplier to the Sauber team. With McLaren three driver championships were scored and in 2009 Brawn GP used the Mercedes V8 to great effect. Their impressive efforts convinced Mercedes-Benz it was the right time to step up and buy the troubled yet highly successful team.
Dubbed the W01, the first 'Silver Arrow' in 55 years was already under development at Brackley long before the team changed owners. With only minimal changes to the regulations, the designers could have sufficed with an evolution of the championship winning machine. A lot of effort nevertheless went into updating the aerodynamics package to complement the superb handling of the chassis. Inspired by the Adrian Newey designed, 2009 Red Bull, the new W01 features a sloping nose with ridges on the edge. Particularly pleasing to the eye is the engine's sculpted air-intake. The V8 engine itself is virtually unaltered and is mated to a seven-speed gearbox.
Even though Ross Brawn sold his stake to Mercedes-Benz, he stayed with the team as principal. His presence must have made Michael Schumacher's decision to leave long-time employer Ferrari a little easier. Brawn was involved in all of the German's seven championships. His compatriot Nico Rosberg was already signed before the team was sold. With such a talented driver line-up, the resources of Mercedes-Benz and the genius of Ross Brawn, the Mercedes Grand Prix team must rank among the favourites for the 2010 championships."
Red Bull Racing RB6 Renault,"Formula 1 is very much a team sport but there are always individuals inside the team that really make the difference. The two drivers are the most visible of these key players. Although operating more the in the background, the chief designer, arguably, is even more important. This was once again underlined by the arrival of Adrian Newey at Red Bull Racing in the spring of 2006. Having already designed championship winning cars for Williams and McLaren, he helped to gradually lift the young team from back of the grid to the very front. Six victories were scored in 2009 and much more was expected for 2010.
Although the 2009 was Red Bull's breakthrough year, the team started it on the back foot because Newey's RB5 did not feature the controversial 'double diffuser', so successfully employed by Brawn GP. Halfway through the season, the Renault engined machine was fitted with a new diffuser and it quickly became the car to beat. The year ended on a high with Red Bull winning the final three races and securing the runner's up position in both the constructor's and driver's championship. With no significant changes to the rules, many believed and feared that Red Bull would be the team to beat in 2010. Anticipation was raised ever further by the team's decision to sit out the first of three pre-season test and instead spend more time in the wind-tunnel.
The result of the engineer's labours over the winter was the RB6, which once again featured Renault's V8 engine in the back. Visually it was clearly a development of the outgoing RB5 with its 'bumps' on the edges of the nose becoming even taller on the new car. These serve to control the airflow over the nose and were copied by almost every other team. Another distinguishing feature of the RB5, the pull-rod rear suspension, also returned on the RB6. This unconventional layout results in a lower centre of gravity and a better airflow out of the back of the car. The biggest rule change was the ban on re-fueling during the race, so a significantly larger fuel tank was required. This had to be carefully placed to limit the effects of fuel load changes on the car's balance.
At the season opening Bahrain Grand Prix, the RB6 immediately made its mark by clinching pole with Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel. During the race, however, a plug failed and the young German was forced to yield certain victory to Fernando Alonso. Vettel was on pole again for the next race, narrowly beating team-mate Mark Webber. Another technical failure for Vettel and an incident packed race for Webber meant that the obvious pace was still not converted in a victory. There were no such problems in Malaysia where Webber scored the team's third consecutive pole position by switching to intermediates on the drying track. It was Vettel who managed to score Red Bull's first, however, beating his team-mate by a handful of seconds.
The RB6's pace in qualifying raised questions about the legality of the car. Some of the rivaling teams were convinced the Red Bull featured adjustable suspension, which allowed it to run low in qualifying and still have enough ground clearance when filled up with fuel for the race. The cars were extensively tested and no illegal parts were found on the car. Later in the season a second complaint surfaced concerning the flexibility of the front wing and floor. While the car passed the existing load tests, the wing was visibly closer to the ground on the track than in the paddock. More stringent tests with higher loads were introduced in August. Some modifications were believed to be made and the RB6 once again passed all tests.
What did give the RB6 its edge over the rivals, was, ironically, the hugely complicated double diffuser layout. Additional downforce was created by also feeding the air from the very low mounted exhausts into the diffuser. This 'blown diffuser' made the RB6 so efficient, that even running on seven cylinders, did not prevent Vettel from setting the fastest time on the twisty section of the Bahrain track. As with all great ideas, it was eventually copied by the rivaling teams. Red Bull Racing was also forced to copy a design feature introduced by another, McLaren. This was the so called 'F-Duct', which, when closed by the driver, fed air onto the rear wing on the straights, significantly lowering the drag. Red Bull's solution required the driver to actuate the system with his left hand, forcing him to drive on the straights with just one hand on the wheel.
Throughout the year the Red Bull team managed to maintain their qualifying advantage, eventually clinching the pole position in 15 of the season's 19 races. Unfortunately the reliability problems remained and drivers also did not perform flawlessly. This was most evident at the Turkish Grand Prix where Webber was chasing his third straight victory and leading the race. Running in second but clearly quicker, Vettel decided to dive up Webber's inside. Inexplicably, he then moved over straight into Webber. The subsequent accident saw Vettel retire and Webber drop down to third. After that there was no love lost between the two team-mates. A few races later, Webber felt he was treated as the team's second driver to Vettel, who is a 'product' of the Red Bull Junior program. All these problems allowed the rivals to pick up more points than warranted by the performance of their cars.
Despite all the struggles, Webber emerged in the lead of the championship with just three races to go. It all seemed to slip away at the inaugural Korean Grand Prix with Webber crashing out early and Vettel retiring with a spectacular engine failure. This once again handed the victory to Alonso, who had very impressively converted a 46-point deficit to an 11-point lead going into the final two races. Webber was dropped to second and Vettel was in fourth, a victory worth of points (25) behind. The Red Bull team shrugged off the bitter disappointment and put in a stellar performance in Brazil. Vettel won the race ahead of Webber but Alonso was in third. Many suggested the team would have been better off in the driver's standings had Vettel yielded victory to Webber. The one-two finish was enough to clinch the Constructor's title.
The very close driver's championship would have to be decided at the Abu Dhabi season finale. In addition to Alonso, Webber and Vettel, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton was still also in the hunt but for him to win it would require a victory and zero points for all his rivals. Vettel made no mistake, took his tenth pole of the season and scored a fine victory. Webber, on the other hand, wobbled in qualifying, setting only the fifth fastest forcing him to start behind Alonso. In the race the Australian stopped early for tyres as did Alonso. They were both caught behind several other drivers who had stopped even earlier and finished a lowly 7th and 8th. This was enough of a gap for Vettel to become the, youngest ever, World Driver's Champion. Interestingly this was also the first time he ever led the championship standings in his career.
Bringing in the silverware for both Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull Racing, the real star of the 2010 season was the Adrian Newey designed RB6. It took 15 pole positions and eventually won 9 races despite all the reliability issues and the struggles within the team. It has confirmed Newey's status as the best designer of the modern era. As far as we can tell the talented Brit is now the only designer in Formula 1 history to have won championships with three different teams. He will once again have his work cut out for him as for 2011 both the double diffuser and the F-duct will be banned."
Renault R30,"The Renault F1 Team took the covers off its 2010 challenger, the R30, in front of assembled media at the Valencia circuit in Spain.
Renault F1 Team driver Robert Kubica was on hand to unveil the car and reveal the exciting new black and yellow livery - the iconic colours made famous by Renault in the 1980s. The team also presented Vitaly Petrov as Robert's teammate for the 2010 season. The 25-year-old finished as runner-up in the GP2 Series last year and becomes the first Russian driver to race in Formula One.
After unveiling the R30, Team Principal, Eric Boullier, joined Robert and Vitaly for a photo call in front of the car, along with the team's Third Driver, Ho-Pin Tung, and Reserve Driver, Jerome d'Ambrosio. Czech driver Jan Charouz will also be a Reserve Driver for the team this year but was unable to attend the presentation.
With stable aero regulations the R30 is a mixture of evolution and revolution, and is much more svelte and attractive than its predecessor. In particular the rear of the car has been considerably reworked to allow the car to make the most of the 'double-decker' diffusers that were first seen last year. Changes have also been made to the architecture of the chassis to adapt to the refuelling ban, which has required the installation of a much larger fuel tank.
Speaking at the presentation, Eric Boullier praised the team's efforts in delivering the new car in time for the first test: ""We've been working flat-out during the winter to ensure that we begin the new season in the best shape possible. The R30 should be a competitive, strong and reliable car, and we've opted for an aggressive development strategy throughout the season. Now we're here ready for the first test and we're all excited to see if the car performs as we think it will.""
Both Robert and Vitaly were thrilled to see their new car and spoke of their hopes for the season ahead: ""The team has been working on the new car for a long time and it's clear that we are moving in the right direction,"" said Robert. ""Now we need to maximise the winter tests to keep up this momentum and continue improving the car. Our priority is to make the car easy to drive because the new rules favour cars that are not too sensitive - we need a car that behaves consistently in a wide range of conditions.""
Vitaly Petrov added: ""The new car looks stunning and the colours remind everybody of Renault's great history in the sport. I can't wait to drive the car for the first time and start working with the team.""
The Renault F1 Team will remain in Valencia until Wednesday evening to complete the first pre-season test session."
Sauber C29 Ferrari,"The BMW Sauber F1 Team will line up lean and hungry for the start of the 2010 FIA Formula One World Championship. Sixth place in last year's constructors' standings will serve as a starting point for the new season. The team's aim is to establish itself at this level despite a lower budget and reduction in manpower. This demands creative thinking and an increased level of efficiency.
Drivers Kamui Kobayashi and Pedro de la Rosa will bring to the team a blend of youth and experience. Japan's Kobayashi made his case with strong performances in two Grands Prix in 2009 and has already recorded his first World Championship points. De la Rosa has 71 Grands Prix under his belt and has earned his place in the statistics for podium finishes and setting fastest race laps. Plus, he also brings with him valuable experience from seven years as a test and reserve driver with a leading team.
Twenty three-year-old Kobayashi can't wait to embark on his first full season in Formula One: ""I'm very proud that Peter Sauber has shown so much faith in me and I'm determined not to disappoint him. My aim is that he will end up being proud of me as well.""
For De la Rosa (38), a long-harboured hope has been realised: ""At last I can feel like a proper racing driver again. I've really missed the competition out on the track. At the same time, though, I've learned a lot technically and on the systems side, and now I want to bring that knowledge to the team.""
The last few months have been very intense for us,"" says team boss and owner Peter Sauber. ""First we had to battle to secure the survival of the team and then we focused on putting a strong set-up in place for the future. The technical preparation of the 2010 car has continued uninterrupted and according to plan since the spring of 2009, despite all the turmoil. We have a long tradition of bringing together an up-and-coming youngster and an experienced campaigner as a driver combination - and it's an approach that has given us a lot of success. Pedro has been working at the highest level technically for many years and for a top team, and we can benefit as a team from this experience. Young Kamui also has a lot to offer us, and last year he impressed me particularly in Abu Dhabi.""
Peter Sauber (66) will be at trackside for the races in his capacity as Team Principal, while Managing Director Monisha Kaltenborn (38) will head up operational matters at the factory in Hinwil. Willy Rampf (56) will celebrate ten years as the team's Technical Director in April 2010 and is again responsible for the coming season's car.
The development of the BMW Sauber C29 has seen the team build on the experience gained last year and the improvement in performance over the final third of the season. However, the new regulations banning refuelling during the race and stipulating a reduced width for the front tyres have required significant changes to the car's design. The increased length of the fuel tank means the car has grown longer overall. And because they are slimmer, the front tyres will be more heavily worked, requiring weight to be shifted further towards the rear of the car.
An eye-catching feature of the C29 is its highly intricate raised nose. Also very distinctive is an extremely long undercut at the transition from chassis into underbody. These and other aerodynamic measures also help to ensure optimum airflow to the double diffuser. Further changes were required to integrate the engine - supplied by Ferrari - and, in particular, the load-bearing Ferrari gearbox."
Toro Rosso STR5 Ferrari,"The STR5 has been designed and built to conform to the technical regulations which apply this year. Although the changes are not as significant as those introduced twelve months ago, they are important enough to have had a major impact on the philosophy of the car.
Possibly the biggest difference stems from the fact that the 2010 car has been designed to make the most of running a double diffuser, whereas in 2009, the car had to be adapted mid-season to make use of this device. Another unusual feature of the new rules is that the introduction of a narrower front tyre was originally conceived as part of a move to facilitate overtaking, in conjunction with the KERS system, which all teams have actually agreed to leave on the shelf this season. Understanding how the new tyres work - the rears also feature a different construction - will be one of the main tasks undertaken in February testing.
Also significant in defining the shape of the car is the ban on refuelling, which requires a much larger fuel cell. This has led to STR5 being longer than its predecessor. Scuderia Toro Rosso has undergone a recent and rapid expansion of its design team and its wind tunnel in Bicester is also a relatively new tool. These two factors mean the overall design of STR5 could be seen as conservative, given that getting a new workforce to operate as a team and validating and learning to trust wind tunnel data is not the work of a moment. The extra fuel load has not just impacted on the shape of the car, as the additional weight has meant a reappraisal of the suspension and braking, as well as other areas. For the fourth consecutive year, the Toro is powered by the Cavallino, as we continue to use the Ferrari 056 V8 engine. With engine development strictly limited, winter work on the V8 has focussed on reliability and fuel consumption, the latter particularly significant this year, with the refuelling ban."
Virgin VR-01 Cosworth,"The new Virgin Racing Formula One team, one of the sport's four new entrants for the 2010 FIA Formula One World Championship, has proudly unveiled its debut race car - the VR-01.
The VR-01 is the first of a new breed of race car designed entirely in the digital domain using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). It is the brainchild of Virgin Racing's Technical Director, Nick Wirth, who has gained an international reputation for pioneering a purely CFD approach to car development, wholly designing, building and testing race cars in computer simulation without the need for expensive, resource-heavy scale-model wind tunnel testing.
A new team for a new era of Formula One, the Virgin Racing team concept looks to exploit and capitalise upon F1's new economic dawn. The team was launched at an event in London last December, but with the focus now firmly on developing the ground-breaking VR-01 for the start of the 2010 season, it was fitting that the roll-out of the new car should also be 'all-digital'. All eyes were on the car's distinctive red and black livery as the VR-01 commenced its tour of duty at a photographic studio, ahead of an official launch presentation on VirginRacing.com. PR commitments completed, the VR-01 was taken directly to Silverstone where it will be prepared for a two-day shakedown prior to its first scheduled test in Jerez next week.
A busy schedule lies ahead, much like the one that has taken the VR-01 from dream to reality in the space of just 10 months. Nick Wirth's design team at Wirth Research in Bicester, UK, started putting the basic layout of the VR-01 together in the early part of 2009 in order to hit the ground running should the team's 2010 entry be successful. 12 days after the team was accepted into the Championship, the design of the monocoque surfaces was locked down and a race against time was underway. The established F1 teams had a significant head start, not least because they had the obvious advantage of evolution, whereas Wirth Research designed the VR-01, quite literally, from a blank computer screen.
Most F1 teams use CFD in the design process but in tandem with scale model testing in one or more wind tunnels. The VR-01 is the product of six months of pure CFD development involving thousands of design solutions generated by the technical team at Wirth Research and the state-of-the-art technology at their Bicester base. In theory, the team's pre-season testing programme began several months ago - in the virtual sense - courtesy of what is widely regarded as amongst the most progressive real-time Simulator technology in motor sport. When race drivers Timo Glock and Lucas di Grassi begin testing in anger next week, the VR-01 should feel very similar to the car they 'drove' on the Wirth Research simulator.
With the VR-01 now a reality, Virgin Racing Technical Director, Nick Wirth, outlined the team's objectives for its debut F1 season and the longer term:
""Today is a very proud day for everyone involved with Virgin Racing, however on this occasion, where the car is the star, I want to pay tribute to all the amazing people at Wirth Research who deserve so much of the credit for the VR-01. Putting together an F1 team, assembling an engineering group and designing a new car from scratch is an epic task in the timeframe we have been working to.
""I have been fortunate to have worked with the very best designers in F1 and I am well aware of exactly what it takes to be successful in this sport. When you see what the existing teams have achieved using the conventional but proven design approach, it is unsurprising that there is a great deal of scepticism about our all-CFD approach. But we are competing in a sport that is undergoing significant change having come face to face with today's harsh economic realities. Under resource restriction, convention will become too costly and necessity really will be the mother of invention. I have absolute belief in the digital design process and the opportunity to put the all-CFD approach to the test at the highest level - to demonstrate that this could be the way for the future of F1 - is very, very exciting.""
Providing a more detailed insight into the new car, Nick continued: ""The VR-01 is the product of an intensive exploration and appraisal of all the factors that go into creating a great racing car, coupled with the more specific parameters of the 2010 Sporting and Technical Regulations. The chassis design implications created by the refuelling ban were obviously considerable. The requirement to carry the entire race quantity of fuel creates significant packaging and optimisation challenges. Similarly, the reduction in the width of the front tyres and the effect that will have on front-end grip called for extensive modelling and simulation work since we had no data to refer to from previous years.
""We believe we have achieved a car that has first-class design integrity and which will benefit from a high degree of aerodynamic efficiency and stability. Reliability has been a major focus and all key areas comply with the FIA safety regulations and crash test requirements for the impact structures - the nose, monocoque, side and rear impact structures - which are particularly stringent in light of the increased fuel load.
Paying tribute to the team behind the team, Nick said: ""We have assembled a fantastic design and engineering group, the calibre of which I could only have dreamed of attracting when we first started out on this journey. They bring an exciting blend of youth, experience and creativity, which is an important part of the make-up of the wider Wirth Research group. Our combined strength in depth ensured we were able to maintain a calm, methodical approach despite the challenging timeframe we were working to. I'm particularly happy that Wirth Research has remained ahead of the game throughout, with chassis manufacture, gearbox design and casting, crash testing and other long-lead processes all coming to fruition well within schedule.
""We are a serious racing team with serious ambitions, so we aren't going to try to run before we can walk. The starting point is to try to run reliably, safely and efficiently and be the best of the new teams. Then we will start to bring performance to the car through a continuous development programme in computer simulation. We fully expect to encounter issues along the way; CFD is an approximation - as is scale-model testing. In both cases, it is only when you hit the track that you can really appreciate the effect of factors that are tricky to model with any technology such as the effect that the real stiffness of all bodywork components and joints has on the airflow for example. We've done all of this before on both closed and open-wheel cars, so I'm pretty confident in the accuracy of our predictions and looking forward to seeing how our starting configuration performs on the race track.
""We have two very focused and determined race drivers in Timo Glock and Lucas di Grassi. The significant effort they have been putting in behind the scenes over the past couple of months in the simulator will prove invaluable as we start to translate our development work to the track-based testing phase.
""It is also fantastic to be working with Cosworth as they embark on a new chapter in their F1 history. They are a strong company and I had the pleasure of racing against them when we were working in Indy cars, where they did a super job. The CA2010 is a nice package and the Cosworth engineers seem very determined to prove themselves again. I'm sure people will see that Cosworth have done a great job.""
Virgin Racing Team Principal, John Booth commented: ""Today is the culmination of a very emotional journey which really began in June last year when we celebrated the fantastic news that our entry into Formula One had been accepted. The celebrations were necessarily brief however, because we were already in a race against time to design and develop a race car at the same time as building a new team of people and premises.
""I have always had the utmost confidence in Nick to design a good race car, just as he has the faith in the race team to make a good job of operating it. Having worked closely with the technical team over the past 10 months, I know that the VR-01 is the product of a very intensive and thorough design and development process and my excitement at seeing our first race car make its track debut later this week is shared by every single person involved with Virgin Racing.
""The first stage in our on-track evaluation programme is our two-day shakedown at Silverstone on Thursday and Friday this week, where we will conduct systematic testing and confidence-building of all car parts and on-car systems. It was always intended that we would miss the first all-team test in Valencia this week and very early on we targeted the second Jerez test in two weeks' time for our public testing debut. It is a testament to our methodical approach and the sheer hard work of the team that we are heading to Spain a week earlier than planned to take part in the first Jerez test next week.
""I would like to congratulate our new race team - a great bunch of guys working together for the very first time in the pressure-cooker environment of a demanding car build schedule. Logistically it hasn't been easy, since the initial build of the two race cars is taking place in Bicester, rather than our operational base in Dinnington. Their commitment and professionalism has been exemplary and they have set their own very high bar in terms of trackside performance this season.
""Finally, not only do we have a great bunch of people at Virgin Racing, we also have a great-looking car. We are delighted with our fantastic new livery which provides a fitting integration of our racing brand with our important commercial partnerships. All in all, we have a lot to look forward to as we progress towards our racing debut in Bahrain next month.""
Summing up the mood within Virgin Racing at today's launch of the VR-01, CEO Graeme Lowdon said: ""The full testing debut of the VR-01 in Spain next week will provide our first chance to see what we have achieved over the past 10 months, however, for me, simply getting to this point is an incredible achievement in itself. None of this would have been possible were it not for the incredible determination of the whole team led by John and Nick including fantastic support from Virgin and LDC in addition to our team partners. I am very proud of our team. We have all the components with which to achieve the ambitious targets we have set for ourselves during the next few years"".
Sir Richard Branson, Chairman of the Virgin group, said: ""What a car! Nick and his design team have done an incredible job and so today they deserve all of the spotlight. It's been fantastic to be part of this journey almost from the very beginning and to see a great engineering mind at work. I'm sure we will be measured by how fast the car is on the track in Jerez next week, but I hope that doesn't overshadow the far bigger achievement of pulling an entire racing team together and taking a brave step that defies convention. In many ways this is an exploration, but given the absolute self-belief we have seen, I can't help but feel very excited about what we can go on to achieve in the years ahead. For now though I'm looking forward to seeing the VR-01 on-track in testing in the coming weeks as we prepare for Virgin Racing's very first grand prix."""
Williams FW32 Cosworth,"During the last couple of seasons Williams F1 braved on as an independent team while most other top teams could rely on substantial support from major manufacturers. Using a Toyota customer engine, the British team showed regularly that more money does not always equal more speed. At many races the Williams proved quicker than the similarly engined but much better funded Toyotas.
Possibly anticipating the withdrawal of its Japanese engine supplier, Williams announced relatively early in 2009 that it would switch to Cosworth power for 2010. To house the British-built V8 engine the Williams engineers had to basically start from scratch with their design for the FW32. The regulations were only modified in detail with the ban on re-refueling as the most prominent change. Obviously a larger fuel-tank was called for, requiring further changes to the design.
The 2009 season had seen a complete revision of the aerodynamics regulations. If that was not difficult enough testing during the year was also banned. So the off-season provided the teams the first change to convert the lessons learned in real changes. As one of the few teams, Williams did not follow the lead of designer Adrian Newey, who fitted a very distinct sloping nose on the 2009 Red Bull. The FW32 in turn has a tall nose, accentuated by the long supports for the front wing.
Not only did the team change engine supplier, it also employed two new drivers. The best known is Brazilian veteran Rubens Barrichello, who ended the 2009 season third in the driver's tables. He will be joined by the highly talented Nico Hulkenberg from Germany. The 22-year old won the 2009 GP2 Championship with a commanding 25 point lead and served as Williams' reserve driver during for two seasons."
BMW Sauber F1.09,"The BMW Sauber F1 Team raised the curtain on its 2009 season in Formula One in Valencia. Robert Kubica (24) and Nick Heidfeld (31) unveiled the new BMW Sauber F1.09. Kubica then took the car for its first lap of the southern Spanish circuit. The team goes into its fourth season with the ambitious aim of fighting for the World Championship title.
BMW Motorsport Director Mario Theissen reinforces the point: ""We have set ourselves the task of further improving our performance relative to the rest of the field. The 1-2 in Canada and a total of eleven podium finishes in 2008 set an exacting standard. In 2009 we are looking to maintain our first-class reliability record while at the same time enhancing our performance levels so that we can be at the front of the pack on a consistent basis. We are aware that we are aiming extremely high. This is the final step in our development, and that's generally the hardest one to take.""
Building the new car represented a massive challenge. Fundamental changes to the regulations have, in many cases, consigned the fruits of experience to the dustbin. Development work on what is a radically different race car got underway even earlier than usual. Indeed, the concept phase for the BMW Sauber F1.09 began back in February 2008. The 2009 car cuts a very different figure from all of its predecessors. Its nose is higher and much wider than before. The huge front wing consists of three elements and stretches across the full width of the car. The rear wing, on the other hand, is considerably slimmer - in line with the new regulations - and stands unusually high against the onrushing air. Intricate aerodynamic add-ons, such as air deflectors and cooling air exits, have been reduced to a minimum. Another eye-catching feature are the sidepods, which are now higher at the front.
2009 also marks the return of treadless tyres (slicks) to Formula One. These will deliver increased front-end grip, which makes moving more weight to the nose of the car an attractive proposition. Counteracting this, however, is another new development which the teams have the option of introducing in the upcoming season: KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System). The component parts of this technology add extra weight at the rear of the car. Alongside aerodynamics and the optimum use of the slick tyres, the integration of KERS represents another key challenge for the engineers. To this end, the front axle has been modified and the rear axle is a new design.
Willy Rampf is responsible for the F1.09 concept and will oversee operations at the race track in his capacity as Technical Coordinator. Managing Director of BMW Sauber AG Walter Riedl will lead the technical department at Hinwil in Switzerland and has responsibility for the development of the car.
While the chassis is the work of the Hinwil team, the KERS technology has been developed in Munich. There, Markus Duesmann (Head of Powertrain) and his team also have the job of preparing the BMW V8 engine for the extra mileage stipulated in the regulations. Each driver is allocated eight engines for the total of 17 races in 2009.
It may be all-change in terms of the engineering behind the car, but the men behind the wheel will be the same as in 2008. The BMW Sauber F1 Team will once again line up on the grid with the Pole Robert Kubica and German Nick Heidfeld as its driver pairing. And 26-year-old Austrian Christian Klien also stays with the team as test and reserve driver.
The team's race drivers both demonstrated impressive reliability in 2008. Kubica racked up the most points for the team. The Pole added his name to the list of Formula One race winners in Canada, brought home the team's first pole position in Bahrain and also notched up three second places and three third-place finishes during the course of the season. For 2009 he is hoping ""that we are as strong at the start of the season as in 2008 and that we can maintain this level of performance up to the final race.""
Kubica's team-mate Heidfeld, meanwhile, collected four second places and recorded the team's first two fastest race laps in 2008. Looking ahead to the new season, he says: ""The team started work early on the wide range of changes. I'm confident that we're in good shape and am looking forward to the first race, when we'll see whether the balance of power has shifted at all.""
The BMW Sauber F1 Team has conducted intensive preparations for 2009 as it attempts to achieve its latest ambitious aim. These have included early testing with KERS and new aero elements. ""In the three years since the BMW Sauber F1 Team was formed, we have always met the goals we set ourselves and are confident that we can do so again this season,"" explains Theissen. However, no matter how motivated the team may be and how much development work they have behind them, gauging their progress against the competition has never been so difficult - as Theissen acknowledges: ""You can plan your level of performance, but not your results."""
Brawn GP BGP001 Mercedes,"One of the great things about sports is the sheer unpredictability of the results. It is not uncommon for the favourite to fail and the underdog to overcome adversity. In a tightly regulated sport like Formula 1 there is unfortunately little room for surprises. The successful teams can develop their winning cars often creating bigger gaps with the competition. Only drastic rule changes can upset the status quo with immediate effect. The start of the 2009 season was a prime example when for once the underdog stole the show. Winning six of the first seven races, Jenson Button and the newly formed Brawn GP left the previous year's top runners well in their wake.
Just a few weeks before the first race of the season, this scenario seemed absolutely impossible. Honda had withdrawn from Formula 1 late in 2008, offering their England based operation for sale. Although there were various interested parties a new owner could not be found. Eventually a management buy-out led by team principle Ross Brawn seemed the only solution. Launched early in March, the 'new' team was labelled Brawn GP and pretty much continued where Honda had left off. Compared to the competition, the team was two months behind on testing. Nevertheless seasoned drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello stunned observers by their pace straight out of the box.
Perhaps forced by the economic or tired of the poor results, Honda could not have timed their withdrawal worse. Very early on Brawn and his men had decided to forget about 2008 and concentrate all their efforts on the new car. Dramatic changes to the aero and tire regulations meant that the 2009 contender would require a virtual clean-sheet design. Honda was the first team to start the developments and had a clear head-start. Insiders already predicted a great year for the team after so many dire seasons. When the Japanese manufacturer announced it would cease the Formula 1 activities many feared we would never get to see just how good the car was.
Three months later we did get to see the new machine. Painted in a white with Day-Glo yellow stripes livery, the Brawn GP BGP001 was revealed at the Silverstone circuit. Honda had also stopped the supply of engines but fortunately Mercedes-Benz were able to increase their production. In record time the Brawn GP engineers adapted the chassis to accommodate for the Mercedes V8 engine. The most controversial element of the car was the 'double decker' diffuser. Even though Ross Brawn had already talked about its legality with the FIA in 2008, many of the other teams were convinced the diffuser was illegal. Toyota and Williams used similar designs and obviously sided with Brawn GP. The protests overshadowed the first races but came to nothing."
Ferrari F60,"The F60 is the fifty fifth single-seater built by Ferrari specifically to compete in the Formula 1 World Championship. The name of the car was chosen to celebrate the Scuderia's participation in all 60 editions of the Formula 1 World Championship since 1950 to date.
The project, which goes by the internal code name of 660, represents the Scuderia's interpretation of the regulations that come into force this year, which include very many new elements. As far as the aerodynamics are concerned, these modifications are the result of the work carried out by the OWG (Overtaking Working Group,) set up by the FIA in collaboration with the teams to produce a set of rules aimed at encouraging more overtaking on track: the front wing, which has a neutral central profile, common to all, is developed mainly on its side elements and is much wider than in the past: the bodywork can no longer carry the slotted apertures that had characterised the Ferrari cars over the past few years.
Other aerodynamic devices are also significantly reduced; the rear wing is higher and narrower than in the past; the diffuser has been moved rearward. The combination of changes naturally led the initial design phase down radically different routes when it came to the side pods and protection components: the apertures have been reduced in size and moved rearward, while the upper and rear elements are larger to aid the exit of air.
The new rules regarding aerodynamics have also led to modifications to the suspension, as these elements can no longer be enclosed to the same extent. The suspension system and the whole layout of the car have been redesigned in the light of the new rules in order to achieve the correct weight distribution.
The design also takes into account two other significant changes in the 2009 regulations: the possibility of using a kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) and the reintroduction of ""slick"" tyres. The KERS on the F60 was designed by Ferrari in collaboration with Magneti Marelli and is centrally mounted on the engine under the rear part of the chassis; its management has involved all departments of the Gestione Sportiva. The return to tyres with no grooves is another element which is down to the work of the OWG, as is the introduction of a flap on the front wing that can be adjusted by the driver when the car is moving.
The software for managing this tool, as well as for the KERS, was designed in Maranello. The transmission has been redesigned to optimise the aerodynamic efficiency of the car. The gearbox casing is again made in carbon and is still positioned longitudinally. The gearbox is fitted with a speed shifter. There is also a new braking system, with calipers designed by Brembo. Other important rule changes for this year stem from the work of FIA and FOTA (Formula One Teams Association) aimed at producing a significant reduction in the teams' operational costs.
As far as the engine is concerned, which retains its longitudinal mounting in the F60 and continues as a load bearing structure, the rules now state that a total of eight engines may be used over the 17 Grand Prix race weekends on the calendar.
Accordingly, the maximum permitted engine speed has been reduced to 18,000 rpm and the distance target for each unit is now around 2,500 kilometres. Furthermore, modifications have been made to the inlet trumpets, the position of the injectors and the configuration of the exhausts. The changes to the regulations mean that, on the reliability front, Shell has played a fundamental role in defining the lubricants for both the engine and gearbox.
As usual, the technical partners have played an important part right from the design and development stage of the entire car. Apart from the aforementioned Shell, a significant contribution has been made by the FIAT Research Centre, especially in the use of its simulation systems and by Brembo, in the development of the braking system. As usual, great attention has been paid to the management and optimisation of the materials used, at the design stage and through quality control, aimed at maximising performance while maintaining the highest possible levels of safety."
Force India VJM02 Mercedes,"The VJM02 represents a radical departure from the design ethos of its predecessor, the VJM01. This year's contender will incorporate a Mercedes-Benz V8 engine and McLaren gearbox, thanks to a new partnership forged in November 2008 between McLaren, Mercedes and Silverstone-based Force India. Fundamental changes in the technical regulations, meanwhile, have led to a major overhaul of aerodynamics, the optional addition of KERS and a compulsory return to ungrooved 'slick' Bridgestone Potenza tyres.
Dr Vijay Mallya, chairman and team principal of Force India, is confident this year's challenger will be the one to bring increased success to his young team after a frustrating points-free debut season, 'To be brutally honest, I would not be happy if we didn't show some much improved, and much needed, performance this season.
'What we really set out to do over the winter was to put in place structures, procedures and partnerships that would give improvement, but crucially, no excuses. By using the same drivetrain as another team, Force India now has a high-level benchmark of its own performance. If performance relative to McLaren - the 2008 championship winning team - is low, there are only a reduced number of variables that need to be analysed and understood.'
Dr Mallya's aspirations are resolutely clear: 'I would like to see a strong start, rising to points mid-season and a definite improvement in qualifying. Regular points finishes should be the aim.'
The VJM02 has been designed in-house at the team's UK facility by a tight-knit unit led by design director Mark Smith and technical director James Key, who have in turn been supported by a small team spear-headed by 2009 project leader Ian Hall.
In addition to the various challenges in interpreting a brand new set of technical regulations, the team has also condensed its development into just five months: the period between the McLaren deal being signed in November and the start of the season. It's been no mean feat to get everything ready, particularly with the team not turning a wheel between its last test in November and the debut of the new car - almost 100 days.
Design director Mark Smith explains the challenge the team has faced, 'When we confirmed the partnership on 10 November 2008 we had to adapt our plans fairly significantly. It's not just a case of getting the new parts and installing them; when we changed the gearbox, it had slightly different suspension mountings and when we changed the rear suspension there was a necessary change on the front.
'Normally you would have started in August, so we have had to compress everything into five months. Everyone has really worked hard to make it work and we've got a potentially better package, so the change has been a positive rather than a negative.'
This year, Dr Mallya will be hoping the positives far outweigh those negatives: 'This is the year we have to deliver. We are not here to make up the numbers, I want to be pushing all the way.'"
McLaren MP4-24 Mercedes,"The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes Formula 1 team launched the car it will campaign in the 2009 FIA Formula 1 World Championship at its headquarters in Woking, England.
Unveiled by world champion Lewis Hamilton and his team-mate Heikki Kovalainen, the new MP4-24 bears little resemblance to its world championship-winning predecessor due to the introduction of a raft of new rules that have radically reshaped Formula 1 ahead of the 2009 season.
Now featuring heavily revised bodywork, re-sculpted front and rear wings, slick tyres and a kinetic energy recovery system (KERS), the MP4-24 has been in development since September 2007 in order to successfully accommodate the huge changes to the technical regulations.
The team has already completed two MP4-24 chassis and begins publicly testing at the Autodromo do Algarve circuit in Portugal on Monday. Test driver Pedro de la Rosa will conduct the first two days before Lewis (Wednesday) and Heikki (Thursday) each spend a day behind the wheel.
With an unprecedented series of rule changes introduced ahead of the 2009 season, the new Vodafone McLaren Mercedes MP4-24 represents a significant departure from its world championship-winning predecessor.
Incorporating new bodywork regulations and the much-heralded return of slick tyres, the team's new challenger not only looks radical but also incorporates a host of new innovative features under the skin, such as a sophisticated kinetic energy recovery system (KERS).
While still retaining the distinctive family look established with both the MP4-22 and MP4-23, this year's car is visually very different from its predecessors as a result of two main factors:
Aerodynamics
This year's aerodynamic regulations were framed by the FIA and the Overtaking Working Group (helmed by Vodafone McLaren Mercedes engineering director Paddy Lowe, Ferrari's Rory Byrne and Renault's Pat Symonds) which met throughout 2007 in order to address the issues affecting passing in Formula 1.
The OWG's influence can be most clearly seen around the front wing, which has been widened to increase front-end load when following another car, and the rear wing - which is now more compact to offer less interference to chasing vehicles. Other factors affecting aerodynamics include the banning of ancillary appendages, the addition of driver-adjustable front-wing flaps and a heavily revised diffuser.
KERS
The MP4-24's KERS device has been developed in collaboration with McLaren and Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines, which has been developing and refining the system for almost two years. With a fully optimised KERS device's output capped at 60kW/400kJ (discharging an additional 80bhp for 6.66s per lap), the development team's primary focus has already shifted to further improving the unit's integration within the chassis in order to minimise performance loss elsewhere within the package.
An optimised KERS package can be expected to deliver a 0.4-0.6s gain per lap."
Red Bull Racing RB5 Renault,"Red Bull Racing's 2009 car, the RB5, made its track debut at the Jerez de la Frontera circuit in southern Spain. If they start giving out championship points for beauty, then the season seems to have got off to a good start as the RB5 is definitely a pretty little beast.
Sebastian Vettel nosed the new car out of the garage into the pitlane and suddenly the countdown to Melbourne seems to have picked up speed. ""It's good that we got the car running without any major problems, but it's much too early to say anything about performance,"" commented Seb after completing a handful laps before lunch. ""Now we are concentrating on checking all the systems, which are very different to those on last year's car. It's good to be back in a racing car again and I feel as though we are on the way to Australia now. It was a strange feeling when I looked in my mirrors, as you don't see anything behind you, no wings or other bits: all you see is the rear tyres and it looks very naked. The view from the front is different too, because of the shape of the nose, but I'll get used to it very quickly"".
On hand to watch RB5's maiden outing were Chief Technical Officer, Adrian Newey and Team Principal, Christian Horner. ""Today's run here in Jerez is the culmination of months of work for all the Red Bull Technology and Red Bull Racing staff, back at base in Milton Keynes,"" said Horner. ""And like any new car launch it's a moment of excitement and speculation. This year will see us benefit from greater stability in terms of how we run the operation, with all our key players in the technical group having been with us for at least two years and we should not forget they designed a car that won a Grand Prix in 2008, in the hands of Sebastian Vettel. There is no reason to believe we cannot do that again with these new rules. We're excited about our driving pairing: Mark's making a great recovery from his broken leg in a very short space of time and the injury has had minimal impact on his preparation for the season. In Sebastian we've got one of the sport's most exciting young talents and he will be looking to build on his very impressive rookie season.""
""2009 arguably sees the biggest rule change for around twenty years,"" said Newey. ""We have taken a clean sheet, blue sky approach, looking at the implications of these rules and how to interpret them, while not changing things simply for the sake of change. Apart from the gearbox internals, there is hardly any carry over from RB4."""
Renault R29,"Following the ING Renault F1 Team's improving performance in 2008, the new R29 is a development in design philosophy aimed at extracting maximum performance from the new aero regulations, slick Bridgestone tyres, and KERS system, whilst further developing the strong features of the R28.
With such radical rules coming into force, particularly with respect to aerodynamics, the team placed great emphasis on maximising the R29's time in the wind tunnel, with aero development already underway by February 2008. CFD has also played a considerable role in the design of the car and has been particularly valuable in understanding the interaction of the aerodynamic package as a whole.
There has been a concerted effort to save as much weight as possible on the R29 to allow for the introduction of the KERS system. As a result, the design team has moved towards using alternative materials and construction methods, such as the carbon-titanium gearbox casing, increased use of MMC aluminium and magnesium.
Renault started the design work of the KERS system in 2007 in conjunction with Magnetti-Marelli. The system consists of a motor-generator, which is connected to the front of the engine (this charges the battery on braking and releases the energy under acceleration), a battery pack located in the chassis and a KERS control unit.
The front end of the car is dominated by the 2009 aero specification wide front wing which has a driver controlled adjustable incidence flap. This looks very different to previous years being much closer to the ground and has much greater influence on the air flow over the tyres due to its increased span. Great attention has therefore been paid to the end plates which have become much more critical devices than they have been in previous years. The front end also has a more radical front suspension layout with new geometry including inclined wishbones and higher monocoque in order to maximise the new slick tyres and improve aerodynamic efficiency.
The rear of the monocoque under the bodywork has changed considerably with the integration of the KERS system, which has taken a lot of effort to package neatly for the minimum weight. The introduction of this new technology has also influenced the car's aero package with careful consideration paid to ensure sufficient cooling.
The bodywork appendages, such as winglets, flicks and chimneys have now largely disappeared with the 2009 aero regulations. The surfaces are therefore much simpler and more streamlined, although the R29 still incorporates the R28-type dorsal fin and flush exhaust exits seen on previous Renault F1 cars. The 2009 rear wing is narrower and higher and reverts back to the centrally-supported single pylon design first introduced on the R26.
The four-race gearbox has a brand new carbon-titanium main case to save weight, and an improved gearshift system developed on the R28, which has also reduced weight and improves performance.
The R29 therefore shares little in common with its predecessor with much of the car designed from a clean sheet of paper. This is particularly true of the aerodynamic package where efforts in the past have concentrated on evolutionary design. The technical team has risen to the challenges of this shake-up in the rules and looks forward to seeing the results of their efforts on the racetrack when the R29 makes its debut this January."
Toro Rosso STR4 Ferrari,"For their fourth car the Red Bull Racing satellite team, Scuderia Torro Rosso, once again relied on a design developed by the parent company. Although the Ferrari powered STR4 and Renault engined Red Bull sister car share the same basic designs, there are some detail differences that will help a trained eye to tell them apart. Compared to the 2008 car, the new Torro Rosso represent a clean sheet designs to comply with the radically changed regulations. A wider front wing, no more winglets and a taller, narrower rear wing make for a completely different look. Drivers for 2009 are debutant Sebastien Buemi and the more experienced Sebastien Bourdais."
Toyota TF109,"Panasonic Toyota Racing officially began the 2009 Formula 1 season in cyberspace today with the world premiere of the team's latest car, the TF109.
The team's eighth season in Formula 1 sees major rule changes so the TF109, revealed exclusively on www.tf109-premiere.com, looked considerably different to its predecessor, featuring wider front wings and narrower rear wings among other modifications.
Today's world premiere completed an exhaustive development process which began in October 2007, when the 2009 regulations were confirmed. The TF109 begins pre-season testing on 19 January at Algarve Motor Park in Portugal.
Despite the TF109's fundamentally different appearance, Panasonic Toyota Racing's ambitious goals remain, as Chairman and Team Principal Tadashi Yamashina states: ""Our target this year is to fight to win the first race for Toyota in Formula 1.""
The significant progress shown in 2008, when the team hit its targets of returning to the podium and significantly increasing its points total, has bred confidence.
Panasonic Toyota Racing achieved two podiums, one front row start and, with 56, scored more points than in 2006 (35pts) and 2007 (13pts) combined. A Toyota was in the top 10 on the starting grid for 14 of the 18 Grands Prix, finishing in the points 12 times, with nine top-six finishes.
President John Howett says: ""We have gained a huge amount of knowledge and improved considerably. There are many elements of our team which are at the very highest level so the challenge now is to fill any gaps and ensure the entire organisation is performing at the very top. Then we must put all the elements together and deliver the success we are all fighting so hard for.""
After consistent and competitive performances in 2008, Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock will continue behind the wheel, joined again by third driver Kamui Kobayashi, who will also race in GP2 Asia and the GP2 Series.
Tadashi Yamashina comments: ""In my opinion Toyota has one of the best driver line-ups in Formula 1 and I am excited to see what they can do with the TF109. Both drivers proved last season that if we give them a competitive car they are capable of fighting with the best in the world, so our challenge this year is to deliver a car which will allow them to do this more often.""
Jarno is preparing for his fifth full season as a Panasonic Toyota Racing driver and his experience has proved invaluable in the team's development, while Timo's natural speed and enthusiasm are the perfect compliment.
The new chassis regulations facing Jarno, Timo and Kamui are motivated by three factors: to make overtaking easier; to limit the continual increase in average speeds and to make the cars' appearance cleaner.
The visual differences are significant, particularly the front and rear wings. At 1800mm, front wings are wider and 75mm lower while rear wings are 75% narrower at 750mm. As well as reducing downforce and speeds, these changes aim to increase a driver's chance to overtake the car in front.
Such a transition gave Panasonic Toyota Racing engineers a clean sheet of paper for the TF109 design, with relatively few concepts carried over from previous cars. Using proven Toyota Way principles, the challenge has been addressed methodically and enthusiastically.
Senior General Manager Chassis Pascal Vasselon says: ""We have worked to the maximum of our capabilities as we always do but this time it had to be special because the rule changes were so big that we had to reconsider everything. So this complete programme has been more demanding on our company than any previous new car project I have been involved in.""
Another change this year sees the return of Bridgestone Potenza slick tyres after a 12-year absence, increasing grip levels and potentially making overtaking easier.
Pascal Vasselon explains: ""If you are following another car closely you lose a lot of aerodynamic performance and that makes it extraordinarily difficult to overtake. So to promote overtaking it is necessary to reduce the reliance on aerodynamic grip, because it is inconsistent, and that is where slick tyres come in, by increasing mechanical grip.""
But it was not only the chassis department who had to adapt to new regulations, with significant modifications in engine rules for 2009 as well.
The engine department has a new look for 2009 following the departure of Senior General Manager Engine Luca Marmorini. Luca made a fantastic contribution to Toyota since the beginning of the Formula 1 project, including invaluable work on the RVX-09 engine and Kinetic Energy Recovery System projects, but he has chosen to leave the team.
Executive Vice President Yoshiaki Kinoshita continues to hold overall responsibility for both the chassis and the engine departments while Kazuo Takeuchi will become Senior General Manager Engine in addition to his role as Director Technical Coordination Engine.
Engine life has been extended from two to at least three Grand Prix weekends, excluding Friday practice, incorporating a limit of eight engines per driver during the racing season.
That measure not only saves cost, it also creates an additional challenge for the engine department, but the team's ambitious targets remain. Yoshiaki Kinoshita says: ""At Toyota, our approach is always to aim high and last season we achieved our target of 100% engine reliability; we had no race-ending issues. I want the team to have the chance to use the engine in the same aggressive way we did last season, with no compromise on performance or reliability.""
As part of this cost-saving measure, and to assist with reliability, engines will be limited to 18,000rpm; down by 1,000rpm on 2008.
Cost-saving is high on the Formula 1 agenda and Panasonic Toyota Racing is committed to reducing expenditure while maintaining the sport as the pinnacle of motor racing.
The Formula One Teams' Association (FOTA) and the International Automobile Federation (FIA) have agreed significant reductions for 2009, including a ban on in-season testing, wind tunnel restrictions and factory closures for six weeks a year.
""These are positive, decisive measures which will significantly reduce costs while retaining the DNA of Formula 1 and that was very important to Toyota,"" says John Howett.
But ensuring value for investment does not stop there for Panasonic Toyota Racing, with increased efficiency and a thorough review of all costs providing direct savings at the factory.
John Howett adds: ""It is vitally important to have a detailed knowledge of what is driving costs, then you need to be able to prioritise the areas which bring value or performance. A lean company must have a culture of waste reduction and constant improvement.
""Happily, these are all factors which Toyota puts particular emphasis on, even in prosperous economic times, so I am confident we are in good shape.""
So, heading into a fascinating Formula 1 season, Panasonic Toyota Racing is completely committed to success on and off the track. The 2009 season starts with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on 29 March, while the 17th and final race is the inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on 1 November."
Williams FW31 Toyota,"The Williams-Toyota FW31, the team's 2009 season race car, made its track debut at the Algarve Motor Park circuit in southern Portugal at the first official Formula One test of the year.
After completing 17 laps this morning in the hands of AT&T Williams' test driver, Nico Hulkenberg, the team was satisfied with initial progress. Technical Director, Sam Michael, said, ""This morning has been full wet, but the weather hasn't really affected what we wanted to do, because our goal has been to get the car out on track, check all the systems work, be sure parts aren't touching each other, nothing is burning, and that's all proved to be okay. It would be good to get some dry running, and the weather should allow this later in the week. In terms of first impressions of the car, we of course haven't spent any time on set-up or performance work yet, that'll all come later, but so far the car is running fine.""
The Williams-Toyota FW31 is the first major clean-sheet car design for perhaps 30 years, driven by a wholesale change in Sporting and Technical Regulations. The new Sporting Regulations are intended to increase car reliability and further reduce costs, while the changes to the Technical Regulations have three objectives - reducing the role of aerodynamics in the car's performance, making overtaking easier and keeping lap times in check. These changes have had significant implications both on the appearance of this season's race car and in shifting its performance baseline.
Sam Michael reflected, ""The changes in the aerodynamic regulations are the most profound and will have the most impact on lap time. There are many immediate visual changes, but also many smaller reductions around the car through new regulation wording and exclusion zones. Starting at the front, the front wing end plate design has changed as the interaction with the front tyre is completely different, and important to control. There are no longer large barge boards - although we managed to squeeze a small one in. The engine cover no longer has the traditional chimneys and louvers on top for cooling, and that has forced a higher and wider exit at the rear in order to provide an effective exit for hot air. Of course the re-introduction of slick tyres is another significant change as it has an influence on the overall dynamics of the race car. Finally, of course, the introduction of KERS is another aspect to the technical picture for the year ahead.""
Michael went on to explain how the changes in aerodynamic rules, which see a much reduced rear wing geometry and conversely, a considerably wider front wing profile, with the front wing flap angle adjustable by the driver in the cockpit, would be the competitive focus for all the teams for much of the year ahead. ""Aerodynamics is likely to be the key to the first two thirds of the season ahead,"" he said, while rating the change to slick tyres as another significant rule change for 2009. ""Finding the optimum weight distribution to optimise tyre performance will also be a high priority going into 2009 and KERS will be the next contributor to race performance. "" Michael confirmed."
BMW Sauber F1.08,"For Technical Director Willy Rampf the philosophy behind the race car for the 2008 season boils down to what he calls ""evolutionary new development"". In other words, last year's car already provided the engineers with a sound basis for the BMW Sauber F1.08, and they did not have to spend time correcting faults. Instead they were able to use knowledge gained over the course of the 2007 season and channel their energies into the development of innovations which build on this basis.
The engineers' development work focused on achieving a high level of aerodynamic efficiency coupled with a stable aero balance: the lower the loss of downforce through corners, the faster the car can travel and the greater the confidence it gives the driver. Other development aims included improving mechanical grip in order to make the best possible use of the standard tyres and reducing the weight of various components to allow maximum use of ballast in optimising weight distribution.
A particularly eye-catching feature of the F1.08 is the mighty front wing. Having said that, the car's nose has actually slimmed down - in equal measure to the rear end. The narrower engine cover has been designed with all-new extra wing elements. Another new and immediately noticeable feature are the hub caps, or ""rim shields"".
Two changes to the regulations have had a major effect on the construction of the cars for the 2008 season: the introduction of standardised electronics (SECU) and the new running time stipulation for the gearboxes (developed in Munich), which must now endure over four grands prix. Since the SECU does not allow for traction control, among other functions, mechanical grip and sensitive accelerator control will gain in importance.
""The data which the F1.08 has delivered ahead of its roll-out is extremely promising,"" says Rampf. ""The development work will continue at full speed up to the start of the new season. Indeed, another aero package will be added to the F1.08 at the forthcoming test, and this will also alter the external appearance of the car once again.""
The BMW Sauber F1 Team was consistently the third-strongest team in 2007 and finished the season in second place in the standings following the exclusion of McLaren Mercedes from the Constructors' World Championship. The team completed its debut season of 2006 in fifth place in the World Championship. Its drivers recorded two podium finishes in each of its first two years - three third places and one second place.
Alongside the unrelenting schedule of the race and testing calendar, the BMW Sauber F1 Team also had to focus on the development of the team in terms of personnel and logistics during its first two years on the grid. Rigorous expansion work has been carried out at its Hinwil base near Zurich since BMW took over the team on 1st January 2006. With its workforce having grown by some 150 people, the team moved into the new extension to the Swiss plant in late 2007. The development and construction of the entire powertrain still takes place in Munich - under the watchful eye of Markus Duesmann - next door to the BMW Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ)."
Ferrari F2008,"The F2008 is the fifty fourth single-seater built by Ferrari specifically to take part in the Formula 1 World Championship.
The design, codenamed internally as the 659, represents the Scuderia's interpretation of the regulations in force in 2008. A major new element of these is the introduction of a new electronic system to be used by all teams, known as SECU (Standard Electronic Control Unit) and produced by MES (McLaren Electronic Systems.) It consists of a single control unit and a software system, the development of which ends as the season begins. Other areas affected by rule changes are: gearbox, which must be used for four consecutive events; safety, with the introduction of higher side protection around the driver's helmet; materials, with a limit to the type of composites that can be used. As a result of these rules, there has been an increase in the weight of the car. All aerodynamic surfaces have been completely revised, however the current version will be replaced by a completely different configuration in time for the first race. In fact, an intensive and all encompassing development programme is planned to run throughout the season. The monococque has been further cut away under the driver's legs and the side pods and engine cover are more tapered. The suspension system has been reworked and developed around the new aerodynamics.
The wheelbase and weight distribution have been adapted to meet the challenge of the new regulations and on the basis of lessons learned last year in terms of the performance of the Bridgestone tyres. Changes to the technical and sporting regulations in terms of electronics, alongside the introduction of the SECU, have led to the removal of a host of a driver aids, such as traction control and engine breaking and the electronically assosted starting system, and also mean that management of the differential, engine and gearchange are much simpler. The gearbox casing is produced in carbon, while the transmission continues to be mounted longitudinally. For the second consecutive year the gearchange is fitted with a quick shift system, adapted to the SECU software and further speeded up. In dealing with the reliability aspect of the new regulations, Shell has played a key role in defining the lubricants for the gearbox. The braking system has been updated with new callipers and innovative concepts regarding cooling.
The 056 engine is mounted longitudinally and continues as a load bearing element. Its basic structure remains unchanged compared to the unit homologated at the start of last season, while its auxiliary systems, air and fuel intakes have been further developed. The technical regulations also call for the use of fuel corresponding to European Union norms, with a content of components derived from biological sources equal to 5.75%. As usual, during the design and development stages of the entire car, our technical partners played an important role. Apart from previously mentioned significant input from Shell , also worthy of note is the contribution of the Fiat Research Centre, especially in providing simulation systems and Brembo for its work in developing the braking system. As is now traditional, a great deal of attention was paid to the performance and optimising of the materials used at the design stage and through quality control, striving to maximise performance levels while attaining the highest possible safety standards."
Force India VJM01 Ferrari,"The Force India Formula One Team today launched its 2008 FIA Formula One World Championship car and unveiled its new livery against the backdrop of the historic Gateway of India in Mumbai. Force India presented its new challenger, the VJM01, in its striking new livery of gold, tungsten and white.
The global launch was attended by several eminent personalities, political leaders and a bevy of celebrities and corporate head honchos along with the leadership team of Force India. Commenting on the launch of the new Formula One Team car, Dr. Vijay Mallya, Chairman and Managing Director, Force India Formula One Team Limited said, ""I am delighted to present before you the livery of the brand new car that will compete in the 2008 FIA Formula One World Championship. Today is a memorable day not only for me as the owner of India's first-ever Formula One team, but also for millions of Indians who can today watch India occupy a place of pride as Force India becomes the first and only Indian Formula One racing team to compete with the best in the world, at the pinnacle of motorsport.""
""The Force India Formula One Team is one of the only eleven elite teams guaranteed an entry into the FIA Formula One World Championship races. The Force India Formula One Team is the new global face of an emerging superpower and is today increasingly viewed as a Team that will change the dynamics of Formula One, bottom up and a Team that dares to dream. Most importantly, the Force India Formula One Team has come to epitomize the dream of every Indian and is powered by the passion of a billion hearts!"", added Dr. Mallya.
The VJM01 will run for the first time at the test in Barcelona from 25 - 27 February 2008. The Force India Formula One Team marks India's first truly global sports foray and embodies all the values that make India a formidable force in the modern world: grit and determination, youth, dynamism and most importantly an unmatched sense of passion.
The management at the newly formed Force India Formula One Team has firmly put down pillars on which the vision would be achieved. Key amongst these would be the commitment to constant innovation and technological progress, continuous commitment of resources and creation of robust infrastructure to support the team and grass root development of the sport in India.
The Force India Formula One Team will be taking key initiatives that will have the force of a billion hearts cheering the pride of India as it races across the globe during the 2008 season. In line with the same, an aggressive marketing campaign has been unleashed which also features one of the sports' most advanced websites, www.forceindiaf1.com and Club Force, the team's official community networking platform.
Based in Silverstone, England, a stone's throw from the famous circuit that hosted the first ever Formula One World Championship race, the Force India Formula One Team has evolved from the iconic Jordan Grand Prix team and the recent Spyker Team. The Team is now a finely tuned, state-of-the-art Formula One entity, ready to challenge some of the automotive industries' greatest brands for track victory. The team boasts a total tally of 4 race wins and 19 podium places gained since its inception in 1991."
Honda RA108,"The Honda Racing F1 Team in 2008 enters its third season under full Honda Motor Company ownership with the new RA108 and an even greater determination to succeed.
The RA108 car is a different concept to its predecessors, in terms of its aerodynamic layout and mechanical structure. The design philosophy has been developed to allow greater scope for aerodynamic packaging and exploitation, particularly to facilitate the introduction of performance upgrades through the season.
The focus has been on attaining a high level of aerodynamic efficiency with stability and this is reflected in the way that the chassis has been revised to interact with the different aerodynamic features and the suspension. This approach is designed to allow more potential for further developments to take place.
The famous RA designation dates right back to the dawn of Honda's bid for grand prix glory during the early 1960s. The company's original F1 prototype that began testing in December 1963 was type-number RA270 and it was fitted with an experimental RA270E 60-degree, 1.5-litre V12 engine. By the time Honda made its Grand Prix debut at the fearsome Nürburgring in August 1964, the early prototype had been superseded by the RA271. Honda's first grand prix win came with RA272 at Mexico at the end of the following season.
The new V8 powerplant, the RA808E, also takes on the evocative RA prefix, which continued through 1983-1992 during Honda's second generation of F1 participation.
The launch of the RA108, with its revised 2008 livery, also marks the start of the next exciting phase of the team's long term environmental initiative, earthdreams. The Honda Racing F1 Team's ethos is one of dedication to sporting excellence, borne out of 40 years of Honda's racing heritage and a shared responsibility for change in our society."
McLaren MP4-23 Mercedes,"The first design meeting for the MP4-23 took place back in November 2006 with early layout work starting in March 2007. Wind tunnel work commenced in late May 2007. Since then the MP4-23 has spent over 3000 hours being developed in the wind tunnel. The first MP4-23 chassis was ready for bonding in mid November 2007.
Lewis Hamilton, Pedro de la Rosa and Gary Paffett had their provisional seat fittings for the MP4-23 back in September 2007. Heikki Kovalainen was fitted for his seat shortly after being announced as a Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver.
The car build process for chassis 1 began in early December 2007 and was finished in early January 2008.
Throughout the development process 150 different engineers have been involved in the whole project in all disciplines.
14000 engineering man hours have so far been put into the MP4-23 development project.
A similar number applies to the manufacturing man hours involved to produce the MP4-23 in time for its track debut on the 9th January 2008.
The MP4-23 is an evolution of the MP4-22 and as such there is no significant visual difference currently, however between now and the first race in Australia there are planned upgrades on most of the aerodynamic surfaces, wings, bodywork, bargeboards and additional bodywork components.
Alongside the development of the 2008 challenger, concept work has been started for the 2009 car since November 2007, with the KERS project (energy storage) beginning a year ago."
Renault R28,"The ING Renault F1 Team's hopes for the 2008 reason rest on the all-new Renault F1 R28. The car ran for the first time in Valencia, on Monday 21 January. During the four-day test, the car completed over 1500 km, indicating strong early reliability in spite of numerous changes to the 2008 technical regulations, including the introduction of the Standard ECU and long-life gearboxes. The team also made encouraging progress with set-up and performance development, allowing the car's debut to be judged as promising.
The new car represents a shift in design philosophy from its predecessor, in order to extract optimum performance from the Bridgestone tyres that all competitors have used since the start of 2007. The new car features revised weight distribution and a new aerodynamic concept to match, which has been enabled by the introduction of a ""zerokeel"" front suspension mounting. The monocoque and bodywork to improve the packaging of the car's mechanical systems while under the skin, the SECU and new gearbox represent the biggest changes. As with all new designs, the team has worked hard to improve stiffness and remove weight throughout the car, to provide maximum setup adjustability from circuit to circuit.
Technical Director Bob Bell labelled the car ""much less evolutionary"" than its predecessor, continuing: ""2007 was a very poor year by our standards. For 2008, there are high expectations inside and outside the team, and it is down to us to give the drivers a competitive car. We have put the problems from 2007 behind us and in terms of the car design, we have looked at the problem afresh. The team pushed very hard in all areas, and particularly on the aerodynamics. The front end of the car has come in for special attention with a brand new front wing and the front suspension. The rear end has also been heavily reworked, and we haven't neglected the basics. The car ran reliably in its first test, and we made encouraging progress on performance development last week. We are confident that the advances we have seen in the wind tunnel will be reflected on track.""
The car will once again be powered by the RS27 V8 engine, which remains substantially the same as last year's unit, given the engine homologation rules currently in force. Engine ancillaries must be homologated by the first race of the year, while the team has also had a heavy workload adapting to the demands of the SECU. ""The transition to the SECU was a big workload, and remains so,"" explained Deputy Managing Director (Engines), Rob White. ""The unit itself is the most obvious change for the new season, but there are many new software tools and programmes that accompany it. We have had to adapt to them all, and learn how to get the most from them. While we are not allowed to develop the engine itself, there remains much to do to assure its reliability in-car performance. These V8's remain complicated and sophisticated, and we must be vigilant about component supply and quality, and concerning changes in the way the engine is used in the car. We are determined to return to the front, and we have worked tirelessly towards this goal for many months.""
The ING Renault F1 Team's race drivers for 2008 will be double world champion Fernando Alonso and rookie Nelson Piquet. Alonso returns 'home' to the team where he won his two world titles after a sabbatical season with rivals McLaren-Mercedes, and has already reacclimatised to life at Renault. He has tested twice with the team this month, setting fastest time at the recent Jerez test with the old R27, before beginning the initial on-track development of the R28 last week in Valencia. The Spaniard scored 15 of his 19 career wins with Renault, and is the only man to have finished in the world championship top three over the past three seasons."
Toro Rosso STR3 Ferrari,"In what has been one of the greatest upsets in Formula 1's recent history, Sebastian Vettel scored a surprise victory in the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. Not only did this make Vettel the youngest ever Grand Prix winner, it was also the very first win for the team that started out in Formula 1 as Minardi back in 1984. The car used that day was the STR3, which was was the third car developed by the team after it had been acquired by Red Bull as a junior team.
The STR3 was developed in conjunction with Red Bull Technology and as such had design input of Adrian Newey. It was a wholly conventional car built around a carbon-fibre composite monocoque and fitted with double wishbones and push-rods on all four corners. Unlike the Renault-engined Red Bull Racing RB3 it was derived from, the STR3 was powered by a year-old Ferrari V8. This was mated to a seven-speed, paddle operated gearbox that was also supplied by Ferrari.
Unfortunately, the STR3 was not ready in time for the start of the 2008 season, so the team fielded an updated version of the STR2 instead. It was suggested that the car would make its competitive debut at the fourth or fifth race of the year but in the end the STR3 was first raced at round six, the Monaco Grand Prix. Having joined the team halfway through the 2007 season, Sebastian Vettel was back behind the wheel of a Toro Rosso in 2008. He was joined by new team-mate Sebastien Bourdais.
The new Toro Rosso proved worth the wait as Vettel debuted the STR3 with a fifth place finish. He would go on to finish in the points eight times in the remaining 12 Grands Prix. The absolute highlight of course was Vettel's victory in a rain-soaked Italian Grand Prix from pole position. In the very wet opening stages, he managed to build up a large enough lead over the intrinsically faster rivals to allow him to score the historic win.
Thanks almost entirely to the STR3, Toro Rosso ended the year sixth in the standings. Embarrassingly, that was actually one better than Red Bull Racing. Vettel stepped up to Red Bull Racing for 2009 and would go on to win four consecutive world titles. Toro Rosso would never be quite as competitive as in 2008 again."
Toyota TF108,"Panasonic Toyota Racing today unveiled the TF108, its entry for the 2008 FIA Formula 1 World Championship and the car it expects to challenge at the front next season. At the team's technical centre in Cologne, Germany, key figures from Panasonic Toyota Racing joined drivers Jarno Trulli, Timo Glock and Kamui Kobayashi to take the wraps off the TF108 in front of the worldwide media and thousands of fans live on www.toyota-f1.com.
Toyota's challenging spirit and determination to meet ambitious targets has played a key part in the evolution of the TF108, with key features of the new car being a longer wheelbase, a major aerodynamic upgrade, revised suspension and a new gearbox. Wind tunnel tests and simulations show the TF108 is a marked improvement on its predecessor and the team expects to move closer to its long-term aim of winning races and fighting for the World Championship.
Since making its Formula 1 debut in 2002, Panasonic Toyota Racing has strengthened and learnt from experience. The challenge of building the entire car - chassis and engine - under one roof, with a new team is significant but everyone at the Cologne technical centre is impatient to succeed and great strides continue to be made towards the ultimate goal.
The TF108 is significantly different to its predecessor, on the outside and the inside, as a result of the team's continuous search for improvement, as well as regulation changes. Formula 1 technology is constantly evolving and the team's designers have kept pace, resulting in noticeable changes for the TF108. A key change is that increase in wheelbase, the distance between front and rear axles. As well as a longer wheelbase, the TF108 boasts a distinctive new aerodynamic concept and advanced suspension lay-outs.
Improvement is not restricted to chassis development and under the skin of the TF108 lies a new gearbox and, importantly, a new electronic control unit (ECU) for the RVX-08 engine. In 2008, all teams must use the same ECU while electronic driver aids such as traction control and engine braking have been banned.
Once again, engine development is frozen so only minor modifications have been allowed in the interests of reliability. However, the development effort from Luca and his team has not lessened; the focus has merely shifted. This has meant concentrating on how the engine is used, dragging every last bit of performance from the package as well as constantly improving the elements around the engine where development is allowed - all this while optimising engine performance with a new ECU and the traction control ban.
Of course, the launch of a new car is only the first step. Panasonic Toyota Racing has set ambitious targets for its latest car and intense development will continue up to and beyond the first race of the season in Australia on March 16, when the final aerodynamic package will be available."
Williams FW30 Toyota,"The AT&T Williams team's 2008 season race car, the Williams Toyota FW30, took to the track at the Valencia circuit in Southern Spain on January 21st for a shakedown prior to starting its winter testing.
The team's newly recruited test driver, Nico Hulkenberg, is taking on the responsibility of shaking down the new race car before regular race driver, Nico Rosberg and his team-mate, Kazuki Nakajima, share first assessments of the car from tomorrow onwards.
The car represents a clear engineering philosophy of iteration and progressive development from the competitive and reliable platform of last season's FW29. The team's Technical Director, Sam Michael explains, ""With four years of regulation stability, we have a good basis to be progressive about the development of this season's car. With a good reliability record last year, we have been able to build on this quality while also turning some of our attention to clear performance objectives.""
With an established technical team, the car is the product of a stable engineering base as well as settled regulations and for the first time since 2004, continuity of engine supplier with Toyota meaning that drivetrain installation has not been a resource-demanding aspect of the design process. With 8,000 mechanical releases and 35,000 manhours of design time, it is remarkable to consider that much of this work will be rendered obsolete in the next eight to twelve months.
The car retains the general structural and layout philosophy of its forebear, featuring a zero keel and dual pillar rear wing, with notable visual changes including a three plane front wing, increased sidepod top cooling louvres in view of the altered orientation of the water radiators, the sidepod and side impact sails and the increased cockpit sides for compliance with the new driver safety requirements.
""Our focus has been on performance as well as refining our packaging and weight distribution. We are designing a tidier car with a higher standard of build quality. The FW30 should represent a good step forward when all of the many small areas of attention and improvement are brought together in the overall package,"" said Michael.
Prior to the roll-out of the FW30, the team has also spent considerable time and made good headway in attending to a number of the other regulation changes, such as the integration of a standard ECU and the outlawing of traction control. As much as a busy winter for mechanical designers and CFD aerodynamicists, specialist code and software engineers have been busy re-writing strategies that will govern the management of the car's main components, from the new seamless shift gearbox to the differentials and engine.
The FW30 is also biofuel compliant in order to meet the new season requirement that all race fuels contain 5.75% biomatter. Having worked in tandem with its fuel partner, Petrobras, the team was the first to use biofuel as part of a Formula One demonstration run in downtown Rio de Janeiro last October.
For its roll-out, the FW30 is liveried in the second of a campaign series of six designs celebrating Williams' thirty years in Formula One. Reflecting the collegiate nature of Formula One, which requires a wide variety of technical and financial contributors, a committed and skilled workforce and the essential support of the viewing public, this week's design communicates Williams' thanks to its staff and its fans.
Every name of the current 519-member Williams workforce will be carried on the FW30-01 this week, and the company also thanks the 85 brands whose sponsorship identities have graced Williams race car liveries since January 15, 1978, when the Williams FW06 took to the track for the Argentine Grand Prix in the hands of Alan Jones. These sponsorship revenues have supported Williams' purity of purpose as an independent racing organisation and the company is indebted to these commercial partners, past and present. The livery also reflects the team's wish to thank the public at large for three decades of support and goodwill which has seen Williams develop a pre-eminent international sporting reputation."
BMW Sauber F1.07,"Time was of the essence in the development of the F1.06, the first car developed by the BMW Sauber F1 Team. Indeed, BMW only took the decision to purchase a majority stake in the Sauber team in June 2005. The components already in the midst of a lengthy development period (the chassis, engine and transmission) were moulded into an overall package - and with notable success, as the results over the course of the season just gone can testify. However, the shortage of time available meant that compromise was unavoidable in certain areas.
The BMW Sauber F1.07 started out from a very different basis. Work on the concept began in April 2006 and took shape as part of a close cooperation between the chassis experts in Hinwil and their colleagues in Munich responsible for the powertrain, i.e. the engine and transmission, and the electronics. Priorities were set out from day one and all the aspects of the project brought together to create a harmonious overall package. To this end, the most significant change is the switch to a single tyre supplier in Bridgestone. In accordance with the stipulations of the FIA, the Japanese company has produced tyres which offer less grip as a means of lowering cornering speeds.
Aerodynamics has been a key area in Formula One for a long time now, but the advent of the single tyre supplier format in 2007 will raise its importance even further. All of which explains why the BMW Sauber F1 Team top brass gave the expansion of the aerodynamics department top priority. The team's use of the wind tunnel in Hinwil was gradually increased, with a move initially from one to two shifts, and from there to a round-the-clock three-shift system in late October 2006. This has given the team parity in this area with its rivals - who have long had comparable systems in place - and fulfilled a central requirement in achieving its ambitious aims.
As always, the key is to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. However, almost as important this year is the need to develop a package that functions as well as possible through corners. Here, the front wing has an influential role to play, largely dictating the flow of air around the front tyres. It has been completely newly developed and forms a harmonious unit with the likewise totally new nose section, which is shorter and sits higher than its predecessor. This results in a reduction in its weight, but also places extra demands on the engineers when it comes to passing the FIA crash tests. The most important aspect of this development, though, is that the wing channels a large amount of air under the car, allowing the underbody and diffusor to work to their full potential.
The cooling intakes are somewhat larger than those on the 2006 car and represent part of a new cooling concept which is more effectively integrated into the overall package and designed to ensure greater air throughput. The air is diverted upwards to maximum effect, improving aerodynamic efficiency compared to last year's car, especially in high outside air temperatures.
The designers built on the knowledge gained with the F1.06 in the development of the rear, giving the tail an even slimmer and lower profile in order to further optimise the air flow around the rear wing. The basis for these modifications is provided by the compact quick shift gearbox and cleverly positioned hydraulic elements. Also integrated into the design are the exhaust pipes, whose form was defined to maximise performance and fit harmoniously into the overall package. The section underneath the rear wing is a totally new development.
More stringent regulations governing rear-end collisions have meant that the rear crash element is now more voluminous overall and also has a modified form. The lower positioning of this element has required a totally revised design for the centre section of the diffusor. The engineers were also instructed to reduce the car's weight, while maintaining its rigidity. The affects the monocoque, which is made up of up to 60 layers of carbon fibre in places, as well as individual components.
The construction of the suspension elements is totally new and, at the front axle, dictated primarily by aerodynamics. The raised nose section mean that the wishbones slant downwards at a striking angle. The kinematics have been modified in response to the introduction of the standard Bridgestone tyres. The rear axle was also modified to further improve traction."
Ferrari F2007,"For the Scuderia Ferrari, 2007 was a watershed year. Gone were the successful team of driver Michael Schumacher, team principle Jean Todt and chief engineer Ross Brawn. Together they had won six Constructors' and five Drivers' World Championships, so they left very big boots to fill. Their places were taken by Kimi Raikkonen, Stefano Domenicali and Aldo Costa respectively. Scoring nine wins in 2006, the 248 F1 was also a tough act to follow.
With its predecessor already so successful and relatively stable regulations between the two seasons, it is no surprise that the subsequent F2007 was an evolution of the existing design. Much of the work over the winter focused on a revised front suspension, which saw Ferrari move from a single- to twin-keel arrangements for the lower wishbones. The wheelbase was lengthened in the section between the cockpit and front suspension to further maximise the aerodynamics potential of this area. Additionally, the F2007 also boasted re-sculpted side-pods and all-new front and rear wings.
Ahead of the 2006 season, the engine regulations had been drastically revised with a reduction in displacement from 3- to 2.4-litre and a maximum number of cylinders set to eight. These relatively small engines could rev to over 20,000 rpm, which did not help the reliability. To sort this issue, a 19,000 rpm rev limit was imposed for the 2007 season. This prompted Ferrari to update the V8 with changes to the combustion chamber, valves and pistons. The water and oil systems were also modified to suit the new requirements. As before, the Tipo 056 engine was mated to Ferrari's own seven-speed, semi-automatic gearbox, which was operated through paddles behind the steering wheel.
Raikkonen immediately showed why he had been signed by Ferrari by grabbing pole, setting the fastest lap and scoring a victory in the opening round of the World Championship. He was the first Ferrari driver to win his first Grand Prix for the team since Nigel Mansell back in 2007. Massa won round three and four but it would take until the eight round that Raikkonen was back to his winning ways. Thanks to a highly successful end to the season with three wins in the last four races, Raikkonen was crowned World Champion, just a single point ahead of McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso. With a combined nine wins, the F2007 also secured the constructors' trophy for Ferrari.
For the 2008 season, the F2007 evolved into the F2008. With eight wins, this was again a successful design and brought one more constructors' championship to Ferrari. Massa ended the year runner up in the championship. Since 2007, no Ferrari driver has won the World Championship."
Honda RA107,"With the RA107 sporting its black and white testing colours in preparation for a reveal of the new team livery next month, the focus was on the development of both team and car since the Honda Racing F1 Team concluded 2006 with a strong 4th place in the Constructors' Championship. As the team put the new car through its paces, the team's management, together with race drivers Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello, spoke of their intent to strive for even greater success in 2007.
Nick Fry, Chief Executive Officer
""We are proud to present the product of a year's excellent co-operation between Honda facilities in the UK and Japan. Although the different engineering groups have worked closely for several years, the RA107 is a true international team effort involving hour by hour communication, strong team work and great team spirit across the globe. This year we aim to build on the latter part of the 2006 season and successful pre-Christmas testing, during which we completed more testing than any other team. We intend to benefit from continuity of drivers and key personnel, combined with performance improvement designed into the new RA107 using our full-scale wind tunnel which was completed last season, to move closer to realising our World Championship ambitions.
""In Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello we have two of the most competitive and experienced drivers on the Formula One grid who work together well and play a pivotal role in team leadership and car development. Supporting them are Christian Klien and James Rossiter, who have made an impressive start to winter testing, completing important development mileage and demonstrating a promising blend of speed, youth and driving experience.""
Shuhei Nakamoto, Senior Technical Director
""We were pleased with the initial performance indications from our first full day of testing with the RA107. There is a great deal of on-track development work to conduct before we embark on the racing season, however positive signs from the car's testing debut provide the reassurance that we have taken a good direction. ""The RA107 is the result of ten months of design, development and manufacture which began almost as soon as the RA106 made its race debut. It combines the efforts of our staff in Brackley and Bracknell with some longer-term projects which have been underway for some time at Honda R&D in Tochigi.
""The main design challenge has been achieving improved aerodynamic efficiency whilst accommodating tough new safety regulations specific to the car's crash structures. I am pleased that we have been able to achieve this objective at the same time as reducing the overall weight of the car. The RA107 also boasts some innovative packaging solutions, particularly around the exhaust and radiators, which allow for much tighter bodywork within what is generally a nicely integrated aerodynamic design package.
""In addition, we are pleased with the way we are developing our understanding of the Bridgestone Potenza tyres and our progress in this area has been due to a combination of the simulation work conducted at our Brackley headquarters and an extremely productive pre-Christmas testing programme which saw our team achieve more mileage than our competitors.
""Engine development has been no less of a challenge because of the homologation regulation. I am pleased with what we have achieved in terms of usable torque and fuel efficiency whilst limiting the engine to 19,000 rpm. We now look forward to the next challenge of optimising the RA107 for the first race in Melbourne on 18 March, with a comprehensive pre-season development programme.""
Jenson Button
""I am looking forward to driving the RA107 for the first time later today, when I will be able to see the result of many months of hard work in Japan and England between both our team and drivers. ""I drove the RA106 here yesterday using the new Bridgestone Potenza tyres for the first time. Today's run will give me the benefit of a direct comparison between the two chassis. Although I have been out of the car for a while, I am very pleased with my return to the cockpit and also my fitness level, which I have been working hard on since Christmas. ""We enjoyed a strong second half to the season last year and of course our first win together will always be special. This year we will hopefully make even greater strides towards our dream of winning the World Championship together and I feel that as we enter our second year under full Honda ownership we have a realistic opportunity of moving closer to that objective. There is a great deal of work to be done between now and Australia.""
Rubens Barrichello
""We had an encouraging first day of running with the new RA107 here in Barcelona yesterday and my first impressions were good ones. I am impressed by how the car and the team have evolved during my first year here and it is clear that the RA107 is a step in the right direction.
""The RA107's new steering and suspension geometry is better suited to the new Bridgestone Potenza tyres, giving a good balance. The revised traction control system also makes it possible for us to get closer to maximising the potential of the tyres.
""I feel confident about the season ahead because I know the importance of a stable team of key staff and drivers. It's great that we have that advantage. I also know just how much work has gone into this car throughout the whole Honda Racing F1 Team organisation and I believe that kind of effort will move us closer to achieving our Championship ambitions. I know that 2007 can be special so I am looking forward to the start of the season."""
McLaren MP4-22 Mercedes,"The event heralds the launch of the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team, which Vodafone is joining as Title Sponsor and Official Mobile Partner. Fernando and Lewis, who form one of the youngest driver line-ups in the history of the sport, will unveil the new livery to an expected crowd of more than 150,000 on a bespoke circuit around the Ciudad de las Artes y de las Ciencias in two MP4-21 race cars. This will be followed by the unveiling of the 2007 car, the MP4-22, which Fernando and Lewis will use to contest this year's Formula 1 World Championship. Pedro de la Rosa and Gary Paffett join Fernando and Lewis to complete the driver line-up. Pedro and Gary, who are starting their fifth and second years with the team respectively, will continue to support the ongoing technical development of the MP4-22 package during the course of the year alongside Fernando and Lewis.
""This is a fantastic day for me - I am really proud to be introducing myself as a Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver in my home country, and of course to help present my new team to the Spanish fans,"" said double World Champion Fernando. ""Although this is my first public event with Vodafone McLaren Mercedes, I have already spent a lot of time with the team and my fellow drivers Lewis, Pedro and Gary, at the McLaren Technology Centre. It is a great team and I am excited about this new beginning. My fans are such an inspiration and it is great to bring the team so close to them. I hope they enjoy watching Lewis and myself drive the cars in their new livery around the streets of Valencia.""
For Lewis, today sees the realisation of a childhood ambition, ""Growing up, I saw so many Formula 1 launches in the media, and to be here in Valencia to unveil the new Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team really brings home to me the distance I have travelled to achieve my dream of becoming a grand prix driver,"" said Lewis. ""There is still a long way for me to go, as I am at the early stages of my career and have a lot to learn, but the passion I have for the sport and this team is immense, I cannot wait to take to the grid in Australia in March. This year will be about firsts for me, starting with today and my first Formula 1 presentation and my first demonstration run. It will be great to take the cars onto the streets and I hope the fans like the new livery as much as I do!""
Ron Dennis, Team Principal of Vodafone McLaren Mercedes and Chairman and CEO of the McLaren Group added: ""This is a very special moment as we officially unveil the team in Valencia today. Vodafone represents only the second title sponsor change in 30 years for the team - something which we as an organization are very proud of.""
""McLaren and Mercedes-Benz have enjoyed a very strong relationship for the past 12 years and we are now looking forward to a successful future as Vodafone McLaren Mercedes,"" continued Ron. ""We all want to win but how we win has always been very important to us and this value will remain the driving force behind our new partnership. In parallel we have developed a brand strategy which we hope will capture and project the youthful and dynamic spirit of the new team. In Fernando and Lewis we have two of the most exciting and talented drivers in Formula 1. They both have great potential to inspire others to push hard to achieve their dreams.""
""I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Generalitat Valenciana and in particular the President Mr. Francisco Camps Ortiz and the Conseller Mr. Gerrado Camps Devesa for their support in making today's event happen. For people to be motivated by something they have to really experience it, and this is what we aim to generate today in Valencia,"" said Ron.
Norbert Haug, Vice President Mercedes-Benz Motorsport: ""Like DaimlerChrysler, our new partner Vodafone is a global company with more than 190 million customers worldwide. This clearly opens up new opportunities and perspectives in the area of communications for the team. With the 2007 line-up of double world champion Fernando Alonso and F1 newcomer Lewis Hamilton, we have both the youngest driver pairing on the starting grid and in the history of the team. Furthermore, when Fernando and Lewis make their debut for the team in the Australian Grand Prix at Melbourne, it will mark the tenth anniversary of the first McLaren-Mercedes F1 victory at the same circuit."""
Red Bull Racing RB3 Renault,"The design process has been led by Red Bull Technology's Chief Technical Officer, Adrian Newey, who looks back over the months leading up to launch. ""One example that illustrates how much more complicated F1 cars have become over the last decade is shown by the fact that I joined McLaren in 1997 on 1 August and we had a brand new car out in February 1998. In contrast, I joined Red Bull in January 2006 and we are only just getting the new car out on time in 2007. This reflects the greater level of research that now goes on in F1 compared to nine or ten years ago. With RB3, we didn't get the model of the car into the wind tunnel until June 2006, which was a lot later than we would really have wanted. That made for a very busy time prior to hitting the key release dates for fundamentals like the monocoque and the gearbox. This had nothing to do with the uncertainty over what engine we were going to run this year. In terms of engine choice, most of the current V8s are broadly similar in terms of installation, so there isn't a big difference in design philosophy depending on which engine you choose. The timing was influenced by the fact that what the team is trying to do for 2007 is a bit different to what's been done in the past. That brought with it its own lead times, also influenced by the need to commission a new wind tunnel in Bedford. All the development of the new car has been done at the Bedford facility, but its commissioning was only completed as we began with the new car. We ran the old car in Bedford just to do a systems check on the tunnel immediately prior to putting the new car model in.""
On the subject of the wind tunnel, Technical Director Mark Smith added: ""The Bedford Wind Tunnel might not be the most up to date facility when viewed from the outside as you come up the driveway! But, as an engineering tool, it's definitely a good piece of kit and something that our Head of Aerodynamics, Ben Agathangelou, has put a great deal of effort into over the last three years. The result is something we can be happy with in terms of its productivity, accuracy and the results it has produced.""
Meanwhile, focusing back on the RB3, Newey explained the concept. ""The car will run to a set of regulations, which are now in their third year as, surprisingly, the change from V10 to V8 did not have a fundamental effect on the packaging of the cars. As far as the aerodynamic regulations are concerned, the last big change came ahead of the 2005 season. As such, the car is an evolution of ideas that have been seen before, but aggressively packaged in a car that we hope will have a lot of development potential. Another factor to bear in mind is that, in common with all the other teams that ran Michelin tyres in 2006, we have to design a car that will run on Bridgestone tyres that we are not yet familiar with. Of course we've done our research, but we've also designed a bit of flexibility in the car to deal with this. Undoubtedly some aspects of RB3 are 'McLarenesque' and are, to some extent, a development of the work I was doing when I was there. In other areas, there are derivatives of what has been done here at Red Bull and, of course, there are some completely fresh ideas. The design cycle has been very compressed which has brought its own pressures on both the engineers and the shop floor, but the response by everybody to that pressure has been truly extraordinary and one which we should be very proud of.""
Car designers are supposed to be notoriously dismissive of the unit that powers their creation, regarding the internal combustion engine as a handy spacer between chassis and gearbox, but Newey is enthusiastic about renewing his relationship with Renault. ""There are a surprisingly large number of familiar faces from the last time we were together! It's great to be back working with Renault. I was always very impressed with their methodology back in the Williams days. They are very good and very pragmatic and can get the best out of a package. Past experience has also shown me they are completely professional when supplying two teams. Their reason for supplying a second team is not for financial gain, but rather to have more units out in the field to learn from in both the performance and reliability areas, which gives a fundamentally different cornerstone to the relationship.""
""Maybe I'm an eternal optimist, but I expect to see us make a good step forward,"" reckons Mark Smith. ""As an absolute minimum I believe we will reach the target area we have set ourselves. Technically I am looking forward to seeing how the car runs, because there are several different design philosophies in Formula One and Adrian has a different philosophy to the one I witnessed in my previous four or five years at Renault, so it will be interesting to see how that pans out. Although all the cars on the grid are quite similar, the way subtleties, such as aero performance, stiffness and mass, are traded off against one another at the design and concept stage can make a big difference when the car hits the track."""
Renault R27,"The ING Renault F1 Team signalled its arrival in Formula 1 in style, with a spectacular media presentation in front of 600 VIPs and media in Amsterdam. Winners of consecutive world championships in 2005 and 2006, the team proudly unveiled new title partner ING and the striking new livery that will adorn the R27 cars throughout the 2007 season and beyond. Renault F1 Team President Alain Dassas spoke of ""exciting challenges"" for the coming season, which will see the team's championship campaign spearheaded by Italian Giancarlo Fisichella, in his third season with the team, and Finnish rookie Heikki Kovalainen.
After evaluating the three top teams in Formula 1, ING selected the Renault F1 Team as the perfect fit for its first global marketing campaign. With a reach of 60 million clients around the world, ING is seeking to exploit its significant investment in Formula 1, which will also include title sponsorship of the opening round of the season in Australia, to grow brand awareness globally. The Renault F1 Team's track record as a proven winner was a decisive factor in their decision to sponsor the reigning world champions.
The ING Renault F1 Team's 2007 challenger has been christened R27. The new car represents an evolution of the design philosophy that won world championship success in 2005 and 2006. Every part of the car has been designed to meet demanding performance criteria that will enable the team to maintain its front-running performance. The aerodynamic packaging represents a further step forward over its predecessor in terms of overall efficiency, and innovative solutions have been employed in a number of areas to achieve improved performance under stable technical regulations. The car also features a new 'instantaneous gearchange' seven-speed gearbox, and has been designed with maximum set-up flexibility in order that its dynamic characteristics can be tuned to suit the Bridgestone Potenza tyres that will be used by every team in 2007.
The new car will be powered by the 2.4L V8 RS27 engine, which has been designed to the requirements of the 'engine homologation' regulations which will be in force for 2007 and beyond. Conceived to limit expenditure on engine development, these rules specify that no performance improvements can be made to the engine relative to the definitive specification that will be submitted to the FIA by 1 March 2007. The engine is based on the RS26 V8 engine that competed in the Chinese and Japanese Grands Prix last season, and has been re-tuned in line with modifications permitted by the regulations for the new maximum rev limit of 19,000 rpm that will be imposed on all competitors.
The RS27 engine will also equip the cars of Red Bull Racing during the 2007 season, under the terms of a new engine supply agreement. The agreement specifies that both teams will use the same specification of engine, and a team of Renault F1 Team engineers will provide trackside support to Red Bull Racing. The new agreement marks the continuation of a tradition that begin in 1983, and which has seen customer Renault engines win 80 Grands Prix since that time.
The R27 completed its first shakedown in Jerez on 16 January, and the team tested at the same circuit from 17-19 January with two brand new chassis - a first for the team, that provides a decisive advantage in allowing both race drivers to accumulate maximum mileage in the R27 before the opening race of the season. The team completed over 2000 km in testing, with only minor early-life reliability problems. Following their first test at the wheel of the new car, 2007 race drivers Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen are already feeling positive about their chances for the new season.
For Giancarlo Fisichella, 2007 will be his third year with the team - and the opportunity to deliver on the promise glimpsed during the previous two seasons. Having been an integral part of the team's championship successes in 2005 and 2006, the Italian will aim to add race-winning consistency to his natural speed in order to become a regular contender at the front of the field. An unquestionable asset will be his extensive Formula 1 experience, as he will be the third most-experienced driver in the field in 2007.
Alongside Fisichella will be new team-mate Heikki Kovalainen, one of the brightest young talents in Formula 1. The Finn has completed over 30,000 km in testing during recent seasons, and has proved his racing credentials as a member of the Renault Driver Development programme since 2002. The team has now offered him the rare opportunity to make his Formula 1 debut in a championship-winning team.
The race driver duo will be aided by newly-recruited test drivers Nelson Piquet Jr. and Ricardo Zonta. They will bring a valuable blend of youthful talent and professional experience to the team, as it manages the transition to Bridgestone tyres while simultaneously building for the future."
Spyker F8-VII Ferrari,"When the company started trading at the beginning of the 20th century it launched the car models named A, B and C to the market. When Spyker CEO Victor Muller resurrected the Spyker name in 2000 he wanted to build on that strong history, ""When we launched the first modern line of Spykers, the C8 Spyder, we called it the C line to follow on from the original model rationale. The E line will be launched in the near future, so it makes sense for our Formula 1 car, our latest model, to be the F line.""
The number eight refers to the number of cylinders of Spyker's Ferrari engine, as with the road going Spykers such as the C8 Spyder, which has an eight cylinder engine as well. The VII sub-designation ('7') refers to Spyker's heritage as an aircraft manufacturer where all models were denoted by roman numerals and stood for the year the aircraft was launched. Hence the F8-VII is the Spyker F line with eight cylinders in 2007. Spyker's aim with the new F8-VII was to create a solid base on which to build, with the real focus is on upgrading the car through the course of the season and preparing for the future.
Key explains: ""We set out with a plan to improve on the areas that we knew needed improving on the M16. We also tried to second guess as best we could what the 2007 tyres were going to do, and we worked hard on aero, which is of course always the fundamental thing. That way we could concentrate all our efforts on performance related areas.
""On the mechanical side, where a system worked well - like the steering rack for example - we more or less left it alone. We've maintained a very high chassis, because we felt that offered a lot of volume for aero devices in that area. We had a twin keel before, and we wanted to tidy it up and make it neater and stiffer. There are little 'bumps' there now, so it's effectively zero keel compared to what we had before.
""We followed the same philosophy that we had with the M16, which was to try to keep as much volume forward as possible. That allows us to make the back as tight as we can. We have slightly lengthened the gearbox, and tried to make sure that our exhaust and radiator volume is pushed forwards, so we've got of bit of scope at the back of the car to do what we like. We've also made a concerted effort to tidy up the outside of the gearbox as well.""
Inevitably, the change of engine supplier was also a focus of attention, ""The Ferrari engine installation was very different to that of its predecessor, so some of the guys who were concentrating on certain new areas had to start working on installing the engine. For example, the hydraulics are our responsibility once more, whereas previously Toyota looked after the system, and it came as part of the engine.
""The back of the chassis is very different, the gearbox design is very different, the fuel system has different requirements. It's not that it's a complicated engine installation; it's just for us a very different configuration compared to our previous two engine suppliers.""
While James and his team have focussed on ensuring the F8-VII is a solid car to start the season with, chief technical officer, Mike Gascoyne, has focussed on putting in place measures that will drastically improve performance later in the year. ""We've started to look at areas that will give a good step forward rather than small ones. With Aerolab on board and a restructure, we can make some real progress. I think you'll see quite a large update to the rear suspension, and a lot of other things will change. The programme we have in the first half of the year is really geared towards making big progress in terms of aerodynamics and design."""
Toyota TF107,"Panasonic Toyota Racing unveiled its new TF107 challenger in Cologne on Friday 12 January, prior to embarking on an intensive test programme in preparation for the first Grand Prix of the season in Australia on 18 March. Toyota is the only one of the 11 F1 teams to go into the new season with the same engine, the same tyre partner, and the same two race drivers. That unique degree of continuity will enable the team to hit the ground running and build on the experience gained over recent seasons.
The team has been strengthened in its quest for success by the arrival of George Tadashi Yamashina, who took over as Vice Chairman of Toyota Motorsport in December. Yamashina will compliment the roles of Tomita and President John Howett, forming a management trio to lead Panasonic Toyota Racing to success.
Last year the team did not meet its high expectations it had after success in 2005 but there is great confidence that the TF107 will see Toyota competing at the front again. The team had a frustrating 2006 season but, in the spirit of kaizen, or continuous improvement, the new car benefits from all the knowledge and experience gained. With the right people in place and the will to win, the TF107 is the product of the team's potential.
While there is continuity in other areas, the TF107 is a completely new car, with virtually no parts carried over from the TF106 and TF106B that preceded it. In 2006 Toyota made the switch to Bridgestone tyres, giving it a head start in cooperating when the Japanese company becomes the sole supplier this year. The experience gained in adapting to new tyres will benefit the team and help it get the maximum out of the tyres available."
Williams FW29 Toyota,"AT&T Williams launched its new race car, the Williams-Toyota FW29, for the 2007 season Formula One World Championship at the team's headquarters near Oxford. In addition to unveiling the team's new race car, livery and racing identity with its new title partner AT&T, the team also confirmed a major new sponsorship agreement with Lenovo, a global leader in the international PC market. This announcement consolidates a strong winter of sponsorship activity for the team.
Reflecting on all elements of the day's announcements, Team Principal Frank Williams said, ""Without question, 2006 was not our finest year but I am delighted to see how the entire Williams workforce has pulled together and redoubled its efforts over the winter. It is how you perform in adversity that really counts. We begin this year with a completely new brand identity courtesy of our new partners AT&T, four new or upgraded sponsors including Lenovo, a wealth of new engineering talent and, of course, what we hope to be the focus of all these efforts and ambitions, the FW29.""
Technical Director Sam Michael explained, ""The FW29 continues the design philosophy of the FW28 with a zero keel configuration. The other notable elements of the design include another step in the undercut of the sidepod leading edge (with top louvres for cooling), improved engine and exhaust packaging to address the reliability issues experienced in 2006 and a lower and narrower top deck for improved aerodynamic efficiency. The other prominent differences from the FW28 include large chimneys expressly for cooling at the season's first three races and a narrower engine cover spine. At the rear of the car, a twin pillar configuration supports a lighter and lower drag rear wing, now featuring FIA-mandatory slot gap separators to prevent deflection and a lower and wider rear impact structure as required by regulation.""
The FW29 passed all mandatory FIA static and dynamic tests and features some of the new regulation safety elements such as Zylon-enhanced side impact structures to protect the driver by virtue of enhanced penetration resistance. From a driver perspective, Nico Rosberg moves forward from his rookie season having gained a year of invaluable experience. ""The experience from last year is going to help me significantly this season. The F1 environment is completely unique and I have learnt how to handle all of its various elements now. In the past weeks everyone in the team has been very positive and put great effort into the new car, so I think we can be optimistic about a much improved season ahead of us.""
Nico is joined by the vastly experienced Alex Wurz who is bubbling with anticipation and excitement about the prospect of racing again. ""Although I have done thousands and thousands of Formula One kilometres in the last couple of years, I simply haven't had enough of the real stuff - racing - so I can't wait for the season to start. There is a really high sense of motivation in the whole team ahead of the coming season and of course I am very proud to be part of the AT&T Williams team.""
Nico and Alex will be ably supported by established tester, Narain Karthikeyan, who will continue to bring his own pace and capability to the test programme. He will be assisted in this role by new recruit, Kazuki Nakajima, who will be contributing to the team's Friday activities at some Grands Prix in the forthcoming season.
Commercially the team has enjoyed a successful winter, recruiting new title partner AT&T and increasing its sponsorship engagements with Philips and Randstad, who both now have on-car presence, an increased investment in response to a positive experience in their first season with the team. Today's announcement that Lenovo has joined the team as a major partner consolidates a robust commercial outlook.
Headquartered in Purchase, New York, Lenovo is an international technology company formed as a result of the acquisition by the Lenovo Group of the IBM Personal Computing Division. With 19,000 employees worldwide and revenues of US$13 billion, Lenovo is a major global manufacturer of computing equipment for both the consumer and enterprise marketplace. The company will support the AT&T Williams team with a wide range of hardware to support a variety of operational activity.
With the advent of a new title partnership relationship, Williams unveiled a new corporate identity, drawing on its thirty year heritage by returning to an iconic 'W' brand device, refreshed and re-interpreted for the team's fourth decade of racing. The new corporate identity forms part of the new racing identity of AT&T Williams. This new identity will be universally unveiled trackside, but is reflected in the new racing livery of the FW29.
Also newly launched today is the team website located at www.attwilliams.com, with vastly improved and increased content, facilities and services for all user communities from consumers to the media and other stakeholders such as team partners. The new site is not only intended to challenge the conventional online presentation of Formula One, but also forms part of a wider cross platform media partnership Williams has entered into with Endemol UK, a global leader in emerging media including format television and other audiovisual entertainment including content to mobile.
With all of these disparate elements of progress over the winter, Williams' Director of Engineering, Patrick Head, neatly summarised the team's approach to 2007. ""Of course we start every project we undertake with the ambition of being the best, whether in engineering or marketing terms and indeed we approach every race with the sole ambition to win. But we are not in the business of predicting the year ahead as that requires me to speculate about the likely performance of our rivals. All I can say is that as an organisation we exist to race and everyone in the company has shown a singular sense of purpose over the winter and so we look forward to Melbourne with anticipation""."
BMW Sauber F1.06,"Although the most important change to the regulations for the 2006 season concerns the engines - down from ten cylinders to eight and 3-litre displacement to 2.4 litres - there are also far-reaching onsequences for the chassis construction. The V8 power units are shorter, use less petrol and require a smaller radiator surface, which has a significant effect on the car's design. The minimum chassis dimensions stipulated by the FIA ensure that the cars' overall dimensions will remain almost unchanged. The reduced tank capacity of the BMW Sauber F1.06 influenced both the design of the monocoque and the position of the engine. Added to which, the shorter engine allowed the engineers to extend the length of the 7-speed transmission's titanium casing. This, in turn, encouraged the construction of a particularly svelte rear end.
Although knowledge gained from the development of the Sauber C24 has not surprisingly found its way into the new car, the BMW Sauber F1.06 is every inch a new design. The engineers focused in particular on aerodynamics, widening their objectives beyond just optimum downforce to enhancing efficiency as well. The construction, arrangement and design of all the car's sub-assemblies and components were based around these criteria. The front section of the new car has been given some striking new features. The chassis has been lowered considerably at the front, with the effect that the lower wishbones are no longer attached below the monocoque but to the side of the chassis. The nose of the car has also been lowered further to the ground, with its underside curving upwards slightly. Naturally, the front wing has been modified in line with the other changes through a host of optimisation measures. All of these measures help to optimise the air flow around the aerodynamically critical underbody.
The reduced cooling requirement of the V8 engine allows not only the use of more compact radiators, but also smaller apertures in the sidepods. This also benefits the car's aerodynamics. The same applies to the rollover bar with integral air intake, which has been reduced in size due to the engine's lower air throughput. Plus, complex finite-element calculations made it possible to significantly reduce the weight of the rollover bar, while at the same time meeting the stringent safety stipulations. The shorter engine has allowed the rear end of the BMW Sauber F1.06 to become even leaner and more harmonious, ensuring optimum air flow over the rear wing. The exhaust tailpipes have been moved further back from their location on the C24. The engineers used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to position them in such a way that the hot exhaust gases are channelled around structural components such as the rear suspension and rear wing in the most efficient way possible.
Revolution, not evolution: the Formula One World Championship will not just be welcoming new engines to the fray in 2006, but a whole new generation of engines. Thanks to a change on the regulations, the new V8 units with 2.4-litre displacement replace the 3.0-litre V10 powerplants which ruled the roost last year. Although the V8 with the now compulsory cylinder angle of 90 degrees may look like a sawn-off V10, technically it is an entirely separate concept with its own specific characteristics. The V8 has a distinct firing sequence and requires a fundamentally different crankshaft design. Whereas a 72-degree offset crankshaft was used in BMW's V10 Formula One engine, V8 powerplants can feature crankshafts with either four throws spaced at 90 degrees or four throws spaced at 180 degrees. Standard production cars are fitted with 90-degree crankshaft variants due to their better dynamic attributes, but a 180-degree crankshaft is favoured in racing-car engine design. The improved performance this allows offsets the disadvantages in terms of dynamics.
In addition to the inherent differences in the design of a V8 engine, numerous other specification details contained in the new regulations have sent the engineers back to the drawing board. Lightweight construction principles have taken centre stage. The new V8 has to be heavier than its predecessor, even through the 2005 engine had two extra cylinders. This season's powerplants must tip the scales at no less than 95 kilograms. This should include the intake system up to and including the air filter, fuel rail and injectors, ignition coils, sensors and wiring, alternator, coolant pumps and oil pumps. It does not include liquids, exhaust manifolds, heat protection shields, oil tanks, accumulators, heat exchangers and hydraulic pump.
Mechanical dynamics and vibrations represent a particularly critical area of development for the new generation of Formula One engines. The V8 units have different firing sequences and intervals from their V10 predecessors, which leads to a totally different situation in terms of vibrations. The V10 entered a critical area between 12,000 rpm and 14,000 rpm. However, this was not an issue as the engine did not spend much time in this rev band and smoothed itself out again once the driver stepped up the revs. And, since the upper rev band was where it spent the majority of its time, vibrations were not a worry. A V8, on the other hand, is not so well off. Its vibration curve enters critical territory later than the V10 - from approximately 16,000 rpm - and continues to climb from there. It's therefore no longer possible to think in terms of getting through a difficult patch and everything will be all right. Now, the problem of constantly increasing vibrations has to be confronted head on."
Ferrari 248 F1,"The traditional press conference held at the presentation of the new single-seater that will compete in the Formula 1 world championship began with the engineers who have developed the car over the past months: Aldo Costa, Ross Brawn and Rory Byrne. Byrne opened and underlined how his role in the company was changing. He was progressively filling a consultancy role for all the new House of Maranello projects and, in particular, regarding the engineering of the cars.
Then came Aldo Costa, creator of the 248 F1, to reflect on Byrne's role and the characteristics of the car in detail. He declared that: ""it was mainly to do with the V8 engine and we imposed a radical change from both a mechanical and aerodynamic point of view. The aerodynamics are still at a preliminary stage and will be until the first race of the season. As regards the chassis, this is totally new, above all in the centre section. We decided on this in order to optimise the weight distribution and lighten the entire structure. The same goes for the suspension, especially in the completely redesigned rear end. The transmission too is all new (though constructed from composite materials) and also the differeential. In building these two new elements in particular, we had to pay close attention to the characterisitcs of the V8. The greater vibrations generated by the engine brought more initial problems"".
The gathered journalists then asked questions to which Brawn replied that ""from the midway point of last season when we realised we could not challenge for the top spots, we began concentrating more on development, especially the blend of the aerodynamic configuration and the characteristics of the new V8. Despite the progress that the Bridgestone tyres have made with the reintroduction of tyre changes, we expect to see lap times that are a second or two slower than last year"". In conclusion, and related again to the tyre issue, Brawn responded to newsprint journalists and emphasised how having Bridgestones this year would be an advantage as they will supply four teams. Now the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro would be able to compare development and the progress being made with other Bridgestone teams"".
After Aldo Costa, Ross Brawn and Rory Byrne came Paolo Martinelli, Formula 1 Engine Director, and Gilles Simon, head of planning and engine development, to face the journalists during the press conference to launch the new 248 F1. ""It is a totally new project"", began Martinelli. ""It is a return to the past, as the name of the car demonstrates. We started working on this engine midway through 2004 and then tested it on the bench. Last August it made its first outing, at Fiorano, and in the autumn of 2005 we completed the V8. Now we are close to the final version. Obviously, in the course of the season we will have to cope with a very steep learning curve.
Gilles Simon's success in development was underlined: ""the calculations were made long ago and even if the regulation changes were related to us rather late in the day, fundamental modifications such as the selection of the centre of gravity had already been made"". ""The rules outline global constraints but do allow a lot of space for projectual experimentation"", continued Martinelli. ""The 90° angle was our choice as was settling on the minimum weight for the non-moving parts. The real challenge, however, was lightening the weight of the moving components"". ""For the first time in ten years a drop in performance was recorded and this was fundamental. The change in power meant some greater investment, but, in the long run, it will be more economical. The overall output of the engine remains unchanged and so some factors were the same as on the V10"".
Martinelli also revealed that there had been some dialogue between the engineers who work on road-going cars and those who concentrate on racing models. ""We met the people who work on GTs and exchange opinion in analysing problems and the methods to resolve them. It was by no means a one-way communication"" ""We were certainly on shared ground"", added Simon. ""However, there are many differences, for example in our time schedules. We made a lot of input and so did they. It was a process of cross contamination""."
Honda RA106,"Honda has tackled the change from V10 to V8 engine by starting from the ground-up with an entirely new design. The development team started on the new concept right after the new rules were introduced over a year ago, and the first track test of a V8 was conducted last April at Mugello, to confirm the various characteristics of a V8 and its interaction with the chassis. Intensive dyno work on further prototypes followed, first in Japan and, since October, in the UK. The team also ran the engine in its Concept car at three tests before the end of 2005.
During the course of development, Honda has been able to draw on its experiences in developing engines for racing in North America. The 10,300 rev limit on engines in the IRL meant that it was work in the 1990's on CART engines (which have no such restrictions) that gave the more useful pointers. In particular, at a certain rev range, resonance frequencies can cause problems with vibrations in a V8, and Honda's CART experience helped it get over this particular hurdle.
As well as the huge change from 10 to 8 cylinders, the development team has also had to adapt to new regulations such as minimum weight and crank heights, plus the banning of certain materials and of variable intake trumpets. The last of these measures will make the optimum torque range narrower, so the designers put a lot of work into improving the torque characteristics in the rev range of the engine just after upshifting. In general, drivability is expected to be more of a challenge, which will favour those drivers with a smoother style.
As well as the challenges in designing the engine itself, of course, Honda engineers have also had to look at how the new unit will affect the package as a whole. Designers in Japan and Brackley have worked very closely together to minimise any negative impact the higher vibrations of the V8 have on areas such as hydraulics and gearbox systems. All these systems have been running reliably in the Concept car in testing so far, which is testament to the good teamwork built up over the years.
Overall, the challenge has been to work within the new regulations to produce an engine with the same reliability as the V10s, which revs to at least the same level. The team is on target to achieve that for the first race, which will provide a good platform for the rest of the season."
McLaren MP4-21 Mercedes,"Coming off the successful 2005 Formula 1 World Championship, the McLaren Mercedes team were faced with extensive rule changes. A further reduction in the maximum engine displacement prompted the introduction of a new generation of naturally aspirated 2.4-litre V8s. Once again supplied by Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines, the new V8 was mated to an updated MP4-20 chassis to create the MP4-21.
Dubbed the FO 108S, the Mercedes-Benz engine was, at least in theory, a further evolution of the existing three-litre V10. The reduction in displacement was such that the V8 could be created by lobbing two cylinders off the V10. The new engine produced around 735 bhp at a mesmerising 19,000 rpm. It was mated to a seven-speed semi-automatic gearbox, which was produced in-house and was actuated by pedals behind the steering wheel.
The carbon-fibre monocoque with push-rod suspension and the aerodynamics package was a comprehensive development of the MP4-20, which had scored ten wins during the 2005 season. This design owed much to the infamous MP4-18, which was a ground-breaking design but proved too extreme and was eventually never raced. Designer Adrian Newey had reworked the design and with the bugs ironed out, the concept turned out to work perfectly.
McLaren had retained the services of drivers Kimi Räikönen and Juan Pablo Montoya, while Pedro de la Rosa served as the test driver. The first MP4-21 was finished in McLaren's classic papaya orange colours. It was submitted to extensive pre-season testing with all three drivers taking turns and racking up a combined 8,700 km behind the wheel of the new car before the season had even started.
Anticipation ahead of the Bahrain season opener was high but a crash in qualifying meant that Räikönen had to start from the back of the grid. He valiantly fought back and and finished third ahead of Montoya in fifth. It would be the first of many podium finishes for the talented Finn but a victory would elude him. A disillusioned Montoya left the team halfway through the year to pursue a NASCAR career. He was replaced by de la Rosa, who finished second at Hungary.
It had been a season of high hopes but ultimately, the third in the Constructors' Championship was a disappointment. After Montoya, Räikönen and designer Adrian Newey also left the team at the end of the year. With the MP4-22 and Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton as drivers, McLaren bounced back once more during the 2007 season."
Renault R26,"In front of world-wide media and VIP guests in Monte-Carlo, the world champion Renault F1 Team today officially launched its 2006 championship campaign with a clear objective: defending the world championship with an aggressive approach to the 2006 season.
For 2006, the Renault F1 Team has adapted to significant changes in the technical regulations governing Formula 1. Teams must now run with 2.4L V8 engines (instead of the 3L V10 used in 2005) which have been introduced in order to cap performance, with an initial reduction in power of approximately 20%. These regulations have been framed in order to reduce the potential for development in the medium and long term, thus cutting costs. The change has necessitated the design and development of a brand new engine, the RS26, by the team at Viry-Chtillon. This project has been led since its inception in September 2004 by Léon Taillieu, under the leadership of Engine Technical Director Rob White.
The package that has been developed around this new V8 powerplant, is the R26 chassis. The work of a team led by Chief Designer Tim Densham, and guided by Chassis Technical Director Bob Bell, the car represents an aggressive evolution of the championship-winning design philosophy from 2005. Although the aerodynamic regulations have remained stable, the team has designed a brand new package to further optimise chassis performance. The R26 ran for the first time in Jerez, Spain on 10 January, and has since completed over 2700 km in the hands of both race drivers. Initial indications on both performance and reliability have been very encouraging.
The race driver line-up for the Renault F1 Team continues unchanged in 2006. The pairing of Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella is among the most complete on the grid, and in the coming season, they will be supported by Finn Heikki Kovalainen as test and third driver, after he finished runner-up in the inaugural GP2 series championship in 2005. World Champion Fernando Alonso will enter the season as the man to beat in Formula 1. After being crowned the sport's youngest champion in 2005, he will hope to defend his world title with the same blend of aggression and precision that defined his driving last year. Although this will be his final season with the Renault F1 Team, the Spaniard enters the new season fully focused on the challenge ahead.
For team-mate Giancarlo Fisichella, 2006 will be a year of confirmation. After finishing fifth in last year's world championship, and playing a key role in Renault's conquest of the constructors' title, the Italian is aiming to establish himself at the front of the field this year, and to fight for the world title.
The final piece in the jigsaw comes in the form of an unchanged portfolio of investment, from the team's partners and official suppliers. In 2005, the Renault F1 Team provided the best value for money on the Formula 1 grid, achieving a winning return on investment for its partner companies. It is a point that Managing Director Flavio Briatore highlights with pride, as he lays down the gauntlet for 2006."
Toyota TF106,"Renowned for its early car launches, Toyota has raised the standards yet again by unleashing its 2006 race car over three months before the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, which is scheduled for 12 March. Technical Director Chassis Mike Gascoyne believes such a head start could offer the Cologne-based team a significant time advantage over its rivals ahead of the winter holiday period. The TF106 marries a brand new rear end, designed to accommodate Toyota's latest specification V8 engine, with a development of the monocoque and front suspension of its pole-setting, podium-scoring TF105B interim car that was brought in for the final two races of the 2005 season.
Panasonic Toyota Racing experienced just one engine retirement over 19 race weekends in 2005, an impressive statistic given the increase to two-race reliability demands for last season. Such an enviable record, coupled with the strong performance of Toyota's V10 in its comparatively short F1 history, have provided invaluable foundations for development of the V8 power unit according to Technical Director Engine Luca Marmorini. The new Toyota RVX-06 V8 engine was testbenched for the first time on 21 March 2005, one day after the team scored its debut podium finish at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Since its first track run at the end of July, the V8 has completed 291 laps over eight separate days, a distance of 2,143km.
In the driving seat for this week's TF106 debut will be 2006 race drivers Ralf Schumacher and Jarno Trulli, who finished 6th and 7th respectively in the drivers' championship in 2005 and helped Panasonic Toyota Racing secure fourth in the constructors' championship. Joining them will be Brazilian driver Ricardo Zonta, who has recently signed a one-year contract extension to be the team's third and reserve driver for 2006. Frenchman Olivier Panis will also continue in an important test drive role in 2006, his fourth consecutive season as a Panasonic Toyota Racing driver.
Panasonic Toyota Racing has three scheduled test sessions prior to the traditional winter break. Following this week's four-day pounding of the Barcelona circuit, the team moves further south to the Circuito de Jerez from 7 December, where it will test for a total of eight days and use its full complement of drivers."
Williams FW28 Cosworth,"Most people involved in the intimacies of Formula One place great value in the principle of stability in the technical regulations - from the rule makers themselves to their intellectual adversaries, the design engineers. Routine changes to the rules that govern the sport cost money and, from an engineer's perspective, changes normally imply more restriction and less freedom to innovate, to exploit new materials or to pursue a promising development break. Generally, then, rule changes are the stuff of nightmares to most ambitious Formula One designers.
However, at a more forensic level of analysis, change to the technical regulations could actually be considered the engineer's friend. With convergence of technological infrastructure between competing Formula One teams and the reduction in latitude for genuine innovation imposed by tighter regulations, the engineering initiative is now largely process-driven. Teams are all working at the very margins of improvement, albeit tenths of a percent in downforce gain or nominal improvements in mass transfer or CofG. Shifting the battle to one that is process-driven means that the team that gets its small increments of improvement to its race car the quickest, and in the most reliable way, will win.
So the 2006 regulations, which have defined the development of the FW28, represent in many ways one of the occasional opportunities that come knocking on an engineering department's door, presenting a step change in a number of key design areas, which in turn promises a rich, rewarding and unpredictable season in prospect. Clearly the biggest transition is the shift away from 3.0l v10 motive power in favour of 2.4l v8, and in Williams' case, the new partnership with Cosworth. With the associated power losses all teams will encounter, everyone is facing a demand for higher aerodynamic efficiency to help compensate. In the case of the FW28, this became a fundamental design parameter for the car and is reflected in many ways across the aerodynamic strategy of the car, visible particularly in the design of the rear wing with its decambered tips. The target here was to maintain downforce while shedding drag at the wing tips. Additionally, a tall sidepod concept was adopted which allowed an even larger undercut and therefore smooth and efficient air flow to the rear of the car.
While designers have been forced to grapple with recouping power losses through aerodynamic efficiencies, the FIA dealt another blow to designers by imposing a new restriction on bodywork to the front of the car, removing the bottom parts of any forward barge boards and, in the process, dramatically altering flow dynamics around the front of the car. The response in the Williams design office has been to pursue a zero keel option to the management of the front wishbones. This area of design has been one of fundamental contention and revision across the Formula One paddock, but the zero keel solution now clearly provides the most efficient aerodynamic solution. In addition, the team has progressed the cascaded front wing, trialled successfully in the last two Grands Prix of 2005.
The revised three part qualifying format, essentially with the first two elements on low fuel and the final session based on race fuel, has had major implications for the approach to 2006 race strategy and in turn, with the design and all-important capacity of the fuel cell. Equally, the regulators decision - after a season of outlawing the practice - to re-enshrine tyre changes has a clear line of influence over the design of the elements of the car that respond to the changing parameters of tyre wear, fundamentally in relation to the mechanical set-up of suspension elements and weight distribution.
If the external factors were not sufficient to keep the design office at Williams busy with the incarnation of the FW28, the technically motivated switch to Bridgestone tyres (which the team last raced in 2000) has demanded a complete revision of weight distribution across the car and a re-formatting of suspension geometry in order to harmonise the dynamic characteristics of the FW28 with the qualities of the Bridgestone tyre. The shift to Cosworth has been another fundamental element in the genesis of the FW28. The development of the CA V8 has been characterised by an open and culturally convergent philosophy between the two organisations, which has been nothing short of positive and productive.
Alongside the new V8 powerplant in the drivetrain design strategy has been the progression of Williams seamless shift technology which is anticipated to come on stream in the early part of the 2006 season. This seven-speed continuous torque gearbox owes much of its development progression to the joint validation work conducted on Cosworth's dynos in Northampton, indicative of the depth and strength of the technical partnership. Seamless transmission can be worth up to 0.4 seconds over the course of an average racing lap.
The team has progressed the development of the FW28, together with the input from its technical partners, with an added degree of relish over the winter. Although not openly admitted, extra challenge presented by the rule changes has galvanised the engineers into a mood of positive engagement. This is, fact, where Williams should be at its best. Fundamental rule changes and new technical partnerships with Bridgestone & Cosworth all equate to a heady cocktail for the Williams design team to tackle. However, the FW28 is a first design for Sam Michael's new combination of Chief Aerodynamicist, Loic Bigois and Chief Designer, Jörg Zander. the first time too, the design team has had the benefit of two onsite wind tunnels dedicated to the new car from the outset and while nothing is meaningful until one Sunday in early March, certainly the circumstances of the FW28's genesis could not be better Williams, nor indeed could the response from its creators."
BAR 007 Honda,"Lucky Strike B.A.R Honda unveiled its 2005 season challenger - the B.A.R Honda 007 car - at the Circuit de Catalunya, Barcelona. The car marks the start of a new era for the team and is yet another major performance step, one which Nick Fry, Chief Executive Officer of B.A.R Honda predicts will launch B.A.R Honda into a new era and its three year challenge to win the World Championship by 2007.
The success of last year's car was the result of a dramatic improvement in engineering standards, teamwork and cooperation between B.A.R and Honda, which enabled the team to move up from fifth to second place in the Championship, marking them out as the season's most improved team.
A significant evolution of the 006, the B.A.R Honda 007 demonstrates a further improvement in design and build-quality. The new car is visibly smaller and its more unified development and integration with the engine has resulted in a tighter, more refined packaging and considerable weight saving despite the more onerous 2005 structural and crash test requirements.
The most visible differences to the external appearance of the car have been driven by the changes to the 2005 aerodynamic regulations, while under the skin the second-generation carbon-composite gearbox is a further development from the team's innovative concept for 2004 and is lighter with improved internals designed and developed under the joint chassis programme.
Honda has produced a new engine to meet the challenge of the two-race rule introduced for the first time this season. Although similar in concept to the 2004 unit, it too is a completely revised design but is smaller, lighter and affords a lower centre of gravity.
For 2005, B.A.R Honda has also developed its partnership with tyre supplier Michelin. In addition to the team conducting an extensive programme of tyre development during winter testing, they have been working closely together on the design of the 2005 car."
Ferrari F2005,"The F2005 is the fifty first single-seater built by Ferrari specifically to compete in the Formula 1 World Championship. The design, which bears the internal code number 656, represents Ferrari's more exhaustive interpretation of the 2005 technical regulations. The main elements, relating to aerodynamics are more advanced than on the F2004 M.
The chassis is lighter, despite the need to strengthen the lateral anti-intrusion panels within the monocoque to increase its ability to meet the requirements of the crash-test, which is stricter than in the past. The shape has been revised, with modifications to the opening of the side pods and the area around the turning vanes. The side pods have been adapted to accommodate the new cooling system.
The engine cover has been redesigned, as have the aerodynamic devices on the side pods, with a secondary winglet introduced in the area of the roll-hoop. The layout of the exhausts is fundamentally different to that of the previous car, eliminating the aerodynamic profile which characterised the rear section, which is now almost entirely integrated within the bodywork.
While retaining the longitudinal architecture for the transmission, the entire rear end has been changed in an attempt to get the most out of the size of the gearbox, which is smaller than its predecessor and made from titanium and carbon fibre. Naturally, the limitations introduced by the new regulations were taken into account during the design stage.
The rear suspension has been revised, with the twin aims of improving the car's dynamics in order to optimise the efficiency of operation for the Bridgestone tyres, while also improving the aerodynamic efficiency of the rear. The floor of the car has also been substantially redesigned to fit in with the new dimensions of the gearbox and comply with the new regulations. Two areas that benefited from a major effort during the design stage were the braking and electronics systems, this work carried out in conjunction with technical partners.
The 055 engine is load-bearing and mounted longitudinally. Much of the internal componentry derives from the last version of the 053, currently fitted to the F2004 M. The main changes centre on the mounting points to chassis and gearbox. Its designers aimed to come up with an engine able to maintain a sufficient level of performance, doubling its life given that the sporting regulations introduced this year require the use of the same engine for two consecutive race weekends. As always, Shell's help has been invaluable in the definition of fuel and lubricants to best meet the set targets.
The F2005 represents the final evolution in a line of Ferrari Formula 1 cars fitted with a ten cylinder engine. As usual, right from the design stage, much attention was paid to performance and optimisation of the materials used as well as quality control, in order to increase performance levels with maximum safety, all within the framework of the new rules introduced this year."
McLaren MP4-20 Mercedes,"The design of the MP4-20 has been heavily influenced by significant revisions to both the sporting and technical regulations that govern Formula One in four key areas: engine lifespan, limitations on tyre use, aerodynamics and race weekend format particularly for qualifying. The aerodynamic modifications have led to the most visible differences on the car, to the design of the chassis, which has been exclusively developed in the design office and wind tunnel facilities at the McLaren Technology Centre. These include the raising of the front wing by 50mm, restricting the height of the diffuser to 125mm and bringing the rear wing package forward by 150mm."
Minardi PS05 Cosworth,"The Minardi F1 Team officially unveiled its 2005 Formula One challenger, the Minardi Cosworth PS05, at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, scene of the San Marino Grand Prix. This followed successful test of the first PS05 chassis at the Mugello circuit, and marks the culmination of nearly five months of intensive effort by Minardi personnel to ensure the team's new car would be ready for its ""home"" Grand Prix. Adding to the significance of the 2005 San Marino Grand Prix, the event marked Minardi's 325th start in 20 years of World Championship competition.
The Minardi PS05 is a dramatic evolution of its immediate predecessor, featuring highly sculpted side pods and a number of aerodynamic innovations aimed at increasing downforce levels, reducing drag, and working in harmony with the wing and diffuser specifications mandated for 2005.
At least as significant as the latest Minardi's aerodynamics is the engine that sits beneath the curvaceous bodywork of the new car. The Cosworth Racing TJ2005 Series 10 power unit represents a major step forward for Minardi in terms of performance, and in combination with the PS05 chassis and Bridgestone tyres, should help the team close the gap to its rivals."
Renault R25,"Introducing the team's 2005 challenger and driver line-up, Renault F1 Team Chairman Patrick Faure announced ambitious objectives for the coming season. The car that carries the team's hopes has been christened the Renault F1 R25. The vehicle project was co-ordinated at Enstone by Technical Director Bob Bell, with Chief Designer Tim Densham and his team working to minimise the initial performance deficit caused by changes to the technical regulations. The car features a brand new integrated electronic system, optimised packaging and detail design as well as an all-new V10 engine, the RS25. Development of the unit has been led by Project Leader Axel Plasse, under the guidance of Technical Director Rob White at Viry-Chtillon. The 72° V10 engine, designed for a reliability target of over 1400 km, features a significantly lower centre of gravity than its predecessor, and has not gained weight in spite of its doubled life cycle. With Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Italian Giancarlo Fisichella, the team also boasts a driver pairing to be measured against the best in Formula One."
Toyota TF105,"Panasonic Toyota Racing lifted the covers on its 2005 race car, the TF105, in front of 200 attending journalists and guests at the historic Estació de Franca railway station in Barcelona, Spain. Creation of the TF105 has been overseen by Mike Gascoyne and Luca Marmorini, respective Technical Directors of the chassis and engine departments. The TF105 is the product of a year-long process in which Toyota has focused on adapting to the challenging new technical regulations put in place by the FIA for the 2005 season. Toyota has approached the 2005 season by continuing to focus on its internal resources and operations in order to enhance efficiency at its factory in Cologne, Germany. The team now believes that this meticulous approach over the past twelve months will enable it to significantly close the gap to the front-running teams this season.
Toyota Motorsport's 600-plus employees hail from 32 different nations, perfectly complementing the truly international stature of the Toyota Motor Corporation. For 2005, the team's highly skilled and experienced F1 personnel have had to consider regulatory changes ranging from aerodynamic restrictions (to reduce downforce) to a stipulation that engines must last for two race weekends. Also new for 2005 are race drivers Jarno Trulli and Ralf Schumacher. The duo brings to Panasonic Toyota Racing a combined total of 257 grands prix experience. Alongside the team's test drivers Olivier Panis and Ricardo Zonta, Toyota can boast one of the strongest, most experienced driver line-ups in the pitlane."
Williams FW27 BMW,"Armed with new drivers, new structures, a new chassis and a new engine, the BMW WilliamsF1 Team is resolved to return to its former strength in 2005, a year which also sees the introduction of new regulations. There are many unknowns awaiting the teams in the forthcoming Formula One season, but one thing is certain: the BMW WilliamsF1 Team will do everything in its power to avoid a repeat of the disappointing 2004 season.
For four years, the BMW WilliamsF1 Team turned up at the race track with the same brace of drivers. During this time, Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher took ten wins between them, including three one-two victories. In 2005, there will be new faces in the cockpits: Australian Mark Webber (28) and German Nick Heidfeld (27) will be lining up on the grid for the BMW WilliamsF1 Team. Whereas Webber was signed up in July 2004, it wasn't until the end of the December '04 and January '05 tests that Heidfeld came out on top against Brazilian contender Antonio Pizzonia (24). Pizzonia was a test driver for the team in 2002 and 2004, and last year competed in four races replacing the injured Ralf Schumacher. In 2005, he will continue as an official test and reserve driver for the BMW WilliamsF1 Team.
Heidfeld brings along the greatest Formula One racing experience of the three. Inclusive of the 2004 season, the German has contested 84 Grands Prix and picked up 28 World Championship points. Webber's tally amounts to 50 Grands Prix and 26 points, while Pizzonia has 15 F1 races and six points under his belt."
BAR 006 Honda,"BAR Honda aimed to rattle the top three F1 teams with its 2004 contender - the BAR Honda 06 launched at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya, Spain. The success of the 2003 car was the result of a dramatic improvement in engineering standards, which enabled the team to move up from eighth to fifth place in the Championship, marking them out as the season's most improved team. A significant evolution of the 05, the BAR Honda 06 is a further step forward in design and build quality and the product of a more challenging and innovative approach.
The chassis is stiffer and has a lower centre of gravity. It also features a smaller fuel capacity to reflect the revised qualifying rules and raised pit lane speeds. The biggest single development is the new gearbox. It features a full carbon-composite maincase, together with narrow, lightweight gear ratios which afford a very substantial weight reduction at the rear of the car. There are further weight-saving features throughout, with greater use of MMC (metal matrix composite), innovative upright design, simplified internal suspension components, and a refined and better integrated hydraulics system.
The engine and chassis allow a slightly shorter wheelbase, and the aerodynamic package has been optimised. BAR has used the results of track testing last year to identify a new strategy for aerodynamic development, and the new car has been developed in the wind tunnel using these new techniques. Although the change of aerodynamic regulations has slowed down the pace of improvement, the new car shows clear performance advantages in the tunnel over its predecessor.
For 2004, BAR has also forged a new partnership with French tyre supplier Michelin. The team has conducted an extensive programme of tyre development during winter testing in readiness for their debut season together, using nearly 1,000 tyres during 10,000 kilometres of testing.
Although BAR's pre season pace was right up there with the top teams, the team's race pace was still a surprise for most. Together with Renault, BAR was the team that challenged Ferrari and Michael Schumacher in the first rounds, filling the void left by the disapoint McLaren and Williams teams. After six races BAR's lead driver Jenson Button was 'best of the rest in championship', in third place behind Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello and Michael Schumacher."
Ferrari F2004,"Continuing the longstanding and often successful Ferrari tradition of gradual development, the Italian team opted to run an evolution of the existing Grand Prix car in the 2004 Formula 1 World Championship. In this particular case that was for good reason as the F2003-GA had provided the team with the fifth consecutive Constructors' title and fourth Drivers' World Championship in a row. Dubbed the F2004, the 'new' machine featured subtle modifications to address the outgoing machine's few weak spots and comply with the new regulations.
Known internally as the Tipo 655, the F2004 was built around a slightly lighter monocoque with revised rear suspension geometry to address the F2003-GA's relatively high tyre wear. The powerful yet reliable V10 was also redesigned to meet the new regulations that stipulated that only a single engine could be used during a Grand Prix weekend. The weight balance was also perfected while the centre of gravity was lowered even further. Subtle revisions were also made to the aerodynamics and a cleaner airflow to the widened rear wing was created by moving the periscope exhaust closer to the car's centre line.
Whereas in previous seasons, Ferrari opted to hand drivers Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello the outgoing cars for the opening races, the F2004 was ready to go for round one, the Australian Grand Prix. Just how ready the car was, was underlined by Schumacher and Barrichello, who started first and second on the grid and went on to score a one-two victory. It would be the start of another dominant performance with Schumacher winning 12 of the first 13 races. Barrichello also added two wins to his tally. By the end of the year, the F2004 had won 15 of the 18 Grands Prix it started in and once again secured both titles for the Italian team.
One of the key elements to Ferrari's success had been the close working relationship with tyre supplier Bridgestone. By 2005, rival Michelin had really got their act together as the subsequent Ferrari F2005 would turn out to be one evolution too many. The Ferrari dominance came to a dramatic end, with Schumacher taking a single win and only because the Michelin shod cars were withdrawn from the American Grand Prix. As a result, the Ferrari F2004 remains as the last hurrah of the team's most successful era that resulted in six consecutive Constructors' titles and five World Drivers' Championships for Schumacher."
Jaguar R5,"Jaguar Racing launched its 2004 challenger, the Jaguar R5 at the Circuit de Catalunya, Barcelona (Spain). Drivers Mark Webber and new signing Christian Klien proudly unveiled the evolutionary contender that aims to build upon the core strengths of last year's car (R4). Alongside Mark and Christian were some of the management team responsible for the Cosworth-powered Formula One car - David Pitchforth (Managing Director), Ian Pocock (Director of Engineering) Ben Agathangelou (Head of Aerodynamics), Rob Taylor (Head of Vehicle Design), Dr Mark Gillan (Head of Vehicle Performance), Dr Ian Pocock (Head of Engineering) and Tony Purnell (CEO Premier Performance Division - which oversees operations at Jaguar Racing, Cosworth Racing and Pi Electronics).
Jaguar may be the name on the car, but without the vital input and support of the team's sister companies Cosworth Racing and Pi Research, along with tyre supplier Michelin, their efforts would be for nothing. Jaguar Racing, Cosworth and Pi make up the Premier Performance Division, a group of companies dedicated to the task of building world-beating race cars, engines and motorsport electronics. Their pedigree is without question: Cosworth Racing is one of the most famous names in the sport, its engines having won races F1 races since the 1960s; and Pi Research is the world's leading supplier of telemetry, data-logging and control systems. Together with Jaguar they make up one of the best teams in racing."
Jordan EJ14 Ford,"Jordan's fourteenth Formula 1 contender was launched on the Silverstone track just over a month before the season start at the Australian Grand Prix. Again the the Jordan F1 racer sports a yellow livery, continuing the team's long sponsorship deal with their main sponsor. Outwardly little changed compared to the EJ13, except for the wings, which were revised considerably to meet new regulations set for the 2004 season."
McLaren MP4-19 Mercedes,"The McLaren Mercedes 2004 Formula One car, the MP4-19, made its track debut at the Valencia circuit in Spain with David Coulthard at the wheel. The design of the MP4-19 has required the incorporation of a number of new FIA Formula One technical regulations for the 2004 season. The single engine rule, which limits each driver to one engine per race weekend marks the most fundamental change. Consequently the Mercedes-Benz FO 110Q V10 is a completely new design, to meet the extended use requirements for the 2004 Formula One World Championship. The new engine is more compact than its predecessor, producing centre of gravity benefits. The Mercedes-Benz FO 110Q ran on the dyno for the first time on 31st July 2003. The revised regulations have also led to the MP4-19 carrying a rear wing restricted to a maximum of two horizontal elements, and an increased engine cover size. Other key visible design differences of the MP4-19 include the relocation of the radiator exit and a top exit exhaust."
McLaren MP4-19B Mercedes,"After a very disapointing start of the 2004 season with the MP4/19, McLaren quickly started work on a revised version to bring the team up to pace again. First launched seven races into the season, the MP4/19B features a slightly revised rear bodywork and sidepods. McLaren hope to enter the MP4/19B as soon as possible and win a race before the end of the season.
At its testing debut at a rainy Silverstone track, Kimi Raikkonen recorded a second fastest time, behind Fernando Alonso in a Renault. Halfway through the season at the French Grand Prix in Magny Cours, the revise MP 4/19 made its debut. Both drivers finished in the points. In the following race on the team's home track Silverstone, Raikkonen qualified the 'B' on pole and converted that to a second place at the end of the race, the team's first podium finish of the season."
Minardi PS04B Cosworth,"At first sight, the Minardi PS04B looks outwardly similar to the 2003 PS03, which is unsurprising given the current stability of Formula One technical regulations. The basic 'architecture' of most teams' cars remains largely unchanged for the 2004 season, although FIA-mandated modifications relating to the dimensions of the engine cover and rear wing end plates have been taken into consideration.
A closer examination of Minardi's new car, however, reveals a wealth of detail change compared with its immediate predecessor, particularly in the area of aerodynamics. Among the major differences are new bodywork, floor, diffuser and front wing, as well as the required alterations to the engine cover and rear wing. The team, in combination with technical partner, Magneti Marelli, has also spent considerable time since the end of the 2003 season developing and improving its on-board electronic systems, and in particular, control software relating to the engine, gearbox and clutch.
On paper, the mechanical layout of the PS04B remains similar to that of its predecessor, with double-wishbone suspension at all four corners of the car employing pushrod-activated rockers working on compact torsion springs. In addition, mechanical anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear. Also retained for 2004 is the 72-degree, Cosworth CR3 V10 - this season, in 'L' (long-distance) specification - acting as a fully stressed member in the chassis. It is mated to a further development of Minardi's innovative, titanium-cased, six-speed semi-automatic gearbox. This compact, longitudinally mounted unit was developed by Minardi staff in collaboration with titanium casting experts, CRP Technology.
The 2004 Minardi ran for the first time at Misano's Autodromo Santamonica in the second week of February, displaying exemplary reliability in the hands of both Zsolt Baumgartner and Gianmaria Bruni. With further successful pre-season testing completed subsequently, the Minardi F1 Team once again approaches the start of a new Formula One World Championship season in a mood of optimism, but tempered with the realism borne of experience."
Renault R24,"From the outside, the R24 can be distinguished by a taller engine cover, and the rear wing, which is limited to two upper elements in order to meet the 2004 regulations. In theory, this configuration brings with it a loss of aerodynamic efficiency close to 6%. However, hard work in the windtunnel has allowed Renault to overcome this deficit: the R24 already has more downforce than the R23B.
Of course, the mechanical package includes the new 72° V10 engine. This architecture did not give any particular problems. One must conceive of an F1 car as a whole, and what is lost in one area can be gained back elsewhere. Thus, the centre of gravity may be slightly higher than in 2003 but this difference is less than 10mm.
The engine/chassis integration is extremely good. Thanks to optimised communications between Enstone and Viry-Chtillon, the overall package is very compact. This characteristic has allowed us to sculpt the bodywork exactly as we wanted to: the new 'v' angle permitted much narrower, tighter sidepods at the rear.
The suspension employs some new materials, but has retained roughly the same geometry as last season. The fuel tank is smaller than in 2003, and the wheelbase has been modified. Finally, the R24 has a 100% titanium 6-speed gearbox, as opposed to a hybrid titanium-carbon construction previously. This change came about to meet teh team's stiffness and weight targets.
Despite the major changes incorporated in the 2004 car's design, the Renault team picked up where it left off at the end of the 2003 season. Although there was no stopping Ferrari's Michael Schumacher in the opening five rounds of the championship, Renault managed to score many valuable points. In the sixth race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix, Renault really showed their worth. Jarno Trulli took his first pole position with a dazzling hot lap in qualifying and he was followed by his team-mate Fernando Alonso. In the race, Trulli made no mistake and scored his maiden victory after 107 Grand Prix entries."
Toyota TF104,"Panasonic Toyota Racing mounts the challenge with TF104 Panasonic. Toyota Racing has used a media open day at its Cologne headquarters as an opportunity to unveil its 2004 race car, the TF104. Designed by Chief Designer Gustav Brunner and his team, the TF104 is an evolutionary redesign of its TF103 predecessor and will play an integral role in the team's aim of closing the gap to Formula 1's leading teams in 2004. Underneath the evolutionary bodywork, the car's internal components have undergone a significant reassessment and redesign that the team is confident will reap rewards in the long term."
Williams FW26 BMW,"The Williams FW26 has a tough act to follow. Its predecessor was widely acknowledged as the class of the 2003 field, not by a long way, but certainly was a significantly faster race car than its rivals once it was optimised. In response, the FW26 was launched and evolved earlier, to extend and accelerate the post-launch development phase. The car design itself represents another step change, in fact the second in as many seasons. This process is challenging and more demanding than iterating an already successful design, but the results, as 2003 proved, provide a compelling reason for taking this course with car development. Under the guidance of Chief Designer, Gavin Fisher, the radical design will be immediately apparent when the FW26 first breaks cover.
The BMW P84 engine has been designed for the 2004 season under the management of Heinz Paschen, Head of BMW Formula One Development. The concept of the engine is based on its successful predecessor, the P83, but all the components have been modified to respond to the new regulations - using the engine over the entire weekend means doubling the life of the engine to 800 kilometres. The goal is to achieve endurance and performance for the substantially greater distances involved. Ingenious and detailed solutions mean that dimensions and weights in spite of the rule changes, have remained virtually the same. Work on the new three-litre V10 cylinder, again with 90 degree bank angle, began in November 2002. Test rig trials were conducted in the summer of 2003, as were the first track tests."
BAR 005 Honda,"BAR Honda marked the beginning of their 5th season in Formula One with the unveiling of their 2003 challenger in Barcelona, Spain. The all-new BAR Honda 005 is the result of a huge effort made by the team over the past year to dramatically improve engineering standards and to lift the performance of the team to a much higher level than previously achieved. In 2002, under the guidance of new technical director Geoffrey Willis, the team committed to design and build a car of outstanding quality. Compared to the 004, the new B.A.R Honda 005 is significantly smaller, lighter, has a lower centre of gravity and is more aerodynamically efficient than its predecessor.
Generally, the B.A.R Honda 005 is the product of a completely revised design philosophy and process, the results of which start with the chassis. It is constructed using an entirely different concept to the previous year's car, with new internal bulkheads making it substantially lighter, whilst maintaining the required design stiffness and meeting all the FIA crash test requirements. The gearbox is all-new, the maincase now being an aluminium investment-casting and using Xtrac internals. The revised suspension layout is also more compact with lay-down torsion springs. The fuel and cooling systems are much more refined. The number of parts used has been reduced by some 10% and the team has reassessed the way it manufactures components in order to make use of lighter materials.
2003 also begins a new chapter in B.A.R's relationship with Honda, which will see the team benefit from exclusive engine supply. The new RA003e V10 engine is lighter, smaller and with a lower mass promises to provide more power as well as an improved torque curve. The Japanese manufacturer will continue to work closely with the team in the area of chassis development. They have also become an official sponsor of BAR. Bridgestone continue with the team as official tyre supplier for the fifth consecutive year. The new technical regulations imposed over the winter have meant that each team will be allowed tyres specifically designed for their cars, so pre-season testing will see B.A.R and Bridgestone working very closely to ensure that they have the best possible package for the new season.
Getting his first taste of the car in Barcelona was British young gun Jenson Button, who joined the team alongside Former World Champion Jacques Villeneuve to create what is undoubtedly one of the most exciting driver line-ups in Formula One today. At only 22, with three seasons in Formula One behind him, Jenson has put his faith in BAR in the belief that the team will provide him with a winning car in the long-term."
Ferrari F2002,"Keen to hold on to the advantage carefully crafted during the previous increasingly successful seasons, Ferrari set about developing a brand new Grand Prix car for the 2002 Formula 1 World Championship. Dubbed the F2002, it replaced the already very accomplished F2001 that took Michael Schumacher to nine wins on his way to his second consecutive driver's World Championship. In fact, it was so good that a slightly updated version won the opening round of 2002 while the F2002 was still being fine-tuned back at the factory.
When the F2002 did break cover, at round three, the Brazilian Grand Prix, it did not look too different from the F2001 raced previously. Nothing could have been further from the truth as underneath the thin carbon-fibre composite skin, the F2002 was indeed brand new. The team lead by technical director Ross Brawn and chief designer Rory Byrne focused on reducing the overall weight and also the car's centre of gravity.
To achieve the ambitious goals set, an altogether lighter carbon-fibre composite monocoque was created. Used as a fully stressed member was the Tipo 051 V10, which may not have been the most powerful engine on the grid but was lighter, more compact, fuel efficient and reliable than its rivals. The hot gasses were routed out of the engine through aerodynamically shaped chimney exhausts. Built specifically for the F2002 was the seven-speed gearbox and its lightweight titanium casing. This incorporated a new-for-2002 clutchless direct shift technology and a new fluid traction control system.
One F2002 was ready for the Brazilian Grand Prix, which not surprisingly was entered for team-leader Michael Schumacher. The German missed out on pole position by a tenth but would go on to clinch a debut victory for the new Ferrari Grand Prix racer. It would be the start of a dominant season, which would see the F2002 win all but one of the remaining 13 races in the 2002 season. Schumacher was crowned World Champion after just 11 of the 17 races by winning the French Grand Prix at Magny Cours. In addition to Schumacher's ten wins, team-mate Rubens Barrichello also grabbed four victories.
With 14 wins in 15 starts during the 2002, the F2002 ranks as one of the most successful Grand Prix cars of all time. One more win was added in 2003 as Ferrari opted to run the F2002 in four more Grands Prix before it was replaced by the new F2003-GA."
Ferrari F2003-GA,"Named after the recently deceased Fiat-CEO, Gianni Agnelli, the F2003-GA is the forty ninth single-seater built by Ferrari to compete in the Formula 1 World Championship. The basic design concept is unchanged from that of the F2002. Attention has been paid to optimising aerodynamic efficiency in addition to further lowering the car's centre of gravity. All areas of the car have been completely redesigned in an effort to get the maximum performance out of the new 052 engine and the Bridgestone tyres.
The chassis is new, both in terms of design and construction saving weight and improving structure over the previous F2002 chassis. The bodywork, radiators, exhausts and the rear end have been redesigned, leading to a further increase in aerodynamic performance. The mechanically operated power steering is also a new design. The front and rear suspension elements have been revised, to maximise the performance of the Bridgestone tyres and to improve the efficiency of the aerodynamic package.
New materials have been introduced to reduce the weight and size of the engine and transmission. Like its predecessor, the new 052 engine is load-bearing and is mounted longitudinally. As usual, Shell made a significant contribution to the evolution of the 052, both in terms of fuels and lubricants, to ensure maximum performance and reliability.
While maintaining the same position and longitudinal mounting, the gearbox is completely a new design, achieving both a reduction in dimensions and weight. The gearbox is cast in titanium with seven speeds (plus reverse) and is electro-hydraulically operated with a sequential shift. In keeping with a trend initiated by Ferrari and now almost universally adopted in F1, the car is fitted with a high level exhaust system, the same layout as seen on the F2002.
The car's centre of gravity is lower than that of its predecessor, producing a further improvement in weight distribution for both chassis and engine. Ferrari believes that with the F2003-GA they have taken a further step forward maximising the performance of innovative materials and design whilst utilising advanced quality control techniques and philosophies to ensure safety and reliability.
At its first outing Michael Schumacher drove the F2003-GA to a lap record on the Scuderia's test track, Fiorano."
Jaguar R4,"With an all new car and two new drivers Jaguar Racing hopes to finally score some good results. The 2002 R3 performed well in the last couple of races and Jaguar hopes to continue that line with the R4. Experienced drivers Pedro de la Rosa and Eddie Irvine have been replaced by rookie Antonio Pizzonia and Mark Webber. The R4 will be powered by an-all new Cosworth engine, which is both lighter and more powerful than its predecessor."
Jordan EJ13 Ford,"For 2003 Jordan have strengthened their team with a new driver and a new engine compared to the 2002 season. In the back of Jordan's 13th F1 car a Ford V10 can be found. The Ford unit replaces the Honda/Mugen engine in the previous seasons. Giancarlo Fisichella is teamed up with Ralph Firman for 2003. The young British driver replaces Japanese driver Takumo Sato who raced for the team in 2002.
Let's hope for the Eddie Jordan run team that it will be lucky 13!"
McLaren MP4-17D Mercedes,"With the technical regulations remained unchanged compared to 2002, McLaren opted to run the 2002 car in the first races of the 2003 season. A practice which lay the base for Ferrari's domination in 2002. The McLaren fielded in the first races of the 2003 season is an evolution of the MP4/17 used in 2002, with various bits of the upcoming MP4/18 already bolted on.
Like Ferrari did last year, McLaren proved it a very successful tactic. The first to races were won by the MP4/17D; in Australia David Coulthard was victorious and in Malaysia Kimi Raikkonen scored his maiden victory. The first European race will probably see the introduction of the MP4/18."
McLaren MP4-18 Mercedes,"After using an updated version of the 2002 MP4/17 for the first races of the 2003 season, the completely new MP4/18 was to make its debut halfway through the season. The MP4-18 incorporates a number of visible differences. These include a shorter and lower nose, a more tightly packaged rear and a slight dorsal fin shaping to the engine cover. Additionally the revised Mercedes-Benz engine, the FO 110P V10, has been lowered within the car, producing centre of gravity benefits. To improve overal performance the engine has been designed in close cooperation with McLaren.
The MP4/18 is the seventh car to appear in the distinctive West McLaren Mercedes livery, introduced at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix, which saw the first victory for the partnership. In the 106 Grands Prix since then, the team has secured 33 race wins, two Drivers' and one Constructors' World Championships.
The MP4/18 proved quick but far from reliable in testing. The MP4/17 proved very reliable and fairly competitive, which made McLaren decide to continue using the old car for the remainder of the season. Engine rule changes left the MP4/18 obsolete for the 2004 season, but many of the '18's' characteristic design elements can be found on the McLaren 2004 contender, the MP4/19."
Minardi PS03 Cosworth,"The Minardi Formula One team's 2003 challenger, the PS03, ran successfully for the first time during a private test session at Ferrari's Fiorano facility. The new car, powered by Cosworth Racing's CR-3 V10 engine, is a carefully considered technical evolution of last year's already effective chassis, and features an improved aerodynamic package and better weight distribution than its predecessor. The performance potential of the PS03 is also notably enhanced, courtesy of the reduced weight, higher maximum engine speed and increased power output of the Cosworth engine compared with last year's power unit. The gearbox is a further development of the innovative, titanium-cased, six-speed transmission that Minardi has used to great effect over the past two years.
Drivers Justin Wilson and Jos Verstappen were both present at Fiorano for the 'roll-out' of the PS03, with the experienced Dutch driver the first to sample the performance of the car. The latest Minardi did not disappoint, and after some software issues were addressed, Verstappen completed a total of 24 trouble-free laps of the famous Italian test track in sunny, but cool conditions, pronouncing himself well pleased with the feel of the PS03 at the conclusion of the afternoon session."
Renault R203,"The Renault F1 Team officially unveiled its 2003 Formula One World Championship challenger at the Lucerne Culture and Convention Centre in Switzerland. In the presence of Patrick Faure, Flavio Briatore and the senior management of Japan Tobacco, the Team's two race drivers, Jarno Trulli and Fernando Alonso, took the wraps off the new R203.
After a fourth place finish in the constructor's championship in 2002, Renault hopes to become the leading Michelin team. This means passing both McLaren and Williams. The R203 still incorporates the wide-angle V10 angle that made the R202 stand out from the rest. New to the team is the talented Fernando Alonso, who replaced Jenson Button."
Sauber C22 Petronas,"The Sauber C22 is the third car that has been constructed under the technical direction of Willy Rampf. With the Sauber C22 everything from the nose to the rear wing is new, and although the car's dimensions were only slightly changed, its proportions are totally different. Specifications for the new car were defined as early as in May 2002. At the same time, the first tests were run in the wind tunnel, laying down the general direction.
Development goals included improved rigidity of parts and a more compact and lighter build. Therefore even more ballast may be placed in the Sauber C22 in order to lower its centre of gravity, and there is more range to adjust the car to the various race tracks.
Due to the new points scale taking effect in the forthcoming season, reliability will also be crucial, since cars finishing seventh and eighth will be awarded championship points. A subsequent effort was thus put into transmitting the C21's reliability to the C22 despite the aggressive design."
Toyota TF103,"Toyota Racing's contender for the 2003 FIA Formula 1 World Championship, the TF103 car is an evolution of last season's TF102, rather than an innovative or radical new design. It is lighter, generates more downforce and has greater aerodynamic efficiency than its predecessor. The TF103 is the product of a design group led by Gustav Brunner and co-ordinated by Keizo Takahashi. The team has already gathered a lot of information about the TF103, thanks to an intermediary version of the TF102, denoted the TF102B, which ran since September 2002 with the 2003-spec engine and seven-speed gearbox. The RVX-03 V10 engine is both lighter and more powerful than the 2002 RVX-02. It has been designed and produced in-house by a technical team overseen by Luca Marmorini.
New for 2003 were race drivers Olivier Panis and Cristiano da Matta. Panis joined the team with nine seasons of Formula 1 experience, including one victory. Cristiano da Matta had been a Toyota driver for four years, having raced with a Toyota engine in the American CART series. The 29-year-old Brazilian won the drivers' championship title in 2002 with seven victories and took Toyota to its first manufacturers' title.
After a difficult start of the season, the TF103's performance increased halfway through the season. After a number of point scoring finishes, one of the season's highlights was the Silverstone Grand Prix where Da Matta and Panis were first and second respectively for a number of laps."
Williams FW25 BMW,"With an innovative chassis, strong engine and raised expectations, the BMW WilliamsF1 Team unveiled its new car the WilliamsF1 BMW FW25 at the Circuit de Catalunya in Spain. The FW25 is shorter than the FW24, under the skin all of the key installations are reworked, not least of which is the drivetrain. In terms of the aero package, WilliamsF1 has approached this car with a new philosophy, which is apparent in the different visual appearance.
The FW25 was designed by a team led by Chief Designer Gavin Fisher at the WilliamsF1 headquarters in Grove, while the engine was designed at the BMW F1 factory in Munich under the guidance of Heinz Paschen (Director of F1 Development).
The partnership between WilliamsF1 and BMW enters its fourth year in 2003, and having so far demonstrated a year-on-year progression towards the ultimate goal of securing a world championship title by 2004, both organisations are acutely aware that there is significant expectation for the season ahead to realise the team's ultimate ambitions."
Arrows A23 Cosworth,"The Arrows contender for the 2002 F1 season is dubbed A23. The Asiatech engine used last year is replaced by a factory spec Cosworth engine also used by the Jaguar team. Not only the engine was replaced, 2000 and 2001 driver Jos Verstappen was replaced by German Heinz Harald Frentzen.
The A23 was designed at Leafield by a team of 20 design engineers, led by Technical Director, Mike Coughlan. The first man to drive the A23 was Enrique Bernoldi who took the wheel for a shakedown in the UK on February 3rd. The car was officially released with the new livery on the Wednesday before the season opening Australian Grand Prix.
The Tom Walkinshaw run team was dogged by money problems throughout the season. Frentzen did score some points but after a couple of races the financial situation forced Arrows to not take part in races. At the end of the season the team officially folded as multiple rescue plans failed to work. Arrows was the second team to go bankrupt within a year, after Prost Grand Prix seized operation early in 2002."
BAR 004 Honda,"B.A.R Honda launched their 2002 season challenger with a dramatic new line-up, but it was Honda's announcement of a long-term commitment to the team that really stole the show. Honda took this opportunity to announce that it has reached agreement for a new three-year partnership with the team. In practical terms that means Honda is stepping up its involvement in the chassis programme and clearly focusing its resources on Formula One to underline its determination to win the World Championship.
The team always said that 2002 would have to be a completely fresh start, and while the team have an all-new car in the shape of the Malcolm Oastler designed BAR 004, this is really only the tip of the iceberg. Honda have designed a completely new engine - the RA002E - with improvements in both power and packaging. The RA002E is lighter, more powerful and has a wider V angle than the 2001 engine, which means a lower centre of gravity. The structure for ongoing development work of the engine has been strengthened.
More news emerged in the form of an additional commitment from technical partner Bridgestone. The Japanese tyre giant announced that it has also laid the foundations for a long-term partnership with British American Racing.
Following the departure of Craig Pollock, the team revealed that David Richards will take over the reins as Team Principal Designate with immediate effect. He joined 200 of the staff members on stage to outline the many positive news stories emerging from the launch.
Once the dust settles on a brief period of upheaval, the team fully expects to see the re-emergence of the gritty determination and single-mindedness borne out of the 2001 reality check."
Ferrari F2002,"Keen to hold on to the advantage carefully crafted during the previous increasingly successful seasons, Ferrari set about developing a brand new Grand Prix car for the 2002 Formula 1 World Championship. Dubbed the F2002, it replaced the already very accomplished F2001 that took Michael Schumacher to nine wins on his way to his second consecutive driver's World Championship.

The German missed out on pole position by a tenth but would go on to clinch a debut victory for the new Ferrari Grand Prix racer. It would be the start of a dominant season, which would see the F2002 win all but one of the remaining 13 races in the 2002 season. Schumacher was crowned World Champion after just 11 of the 17 races by winning the French Grand Prix at Magny Cours. In addition to Schumacher's ten wins, team-mate Rubens Barrichello also grabbed four victories.
With 14 wins in 15 starts during the 2002, the F2002 ranks as one of the most successful Grand Prix cars of all time. One more win was added in 2003 as Ferrari opted to run the F2002 in four more Grands Prix before it was replaced by the new F2003-GA."
Jaguar R3,"The third team to launch their new car was Jaguar on January 4th, just in time to start the pre-season testing with the new car. R3 was designed by Chief Designer John Russell and Chief Aerodynamicist Mark Handford and their teams, under the overall direction of Technical Director Steve Nichols.
Announced alongside the Jaguar R3 is a new technical partnership with Castrol. Castrol is increasing its involvement in Formula One by becoming partner to Jaguar Racing in an agreement that includes the supply of engine oil, transmission fluids as well as dedicated technical support to the team at races and tests. In addition to lubricants, Castrol will also draw on the technical resources of its parent company, BP, to provide Jaguar Racing with associated fuels.
The R3 is again powered by the Cosworth CR-3 V10 engine that powered the Jaguar R2 in the 2001 season. Cosworth Racing, the most successful engine builder in Formula One history, will continue to develop the engine throughout the season."
Jordan EJ12 Honda,"The Jordan Honda EJ12 is Jordan's second Formula One car to incorporate a 'works' Honda engine, the RA002E, which is packaged differently than its 2001 predecessor. As a consequence, the chassis rear bulkhead has been modified to suit the new engine.
The EJ12 incorporates heavy design revisions to the front of the chassis, therefore requiring a re-packaged front suspension system. New materials and production techniques have been utilised in the chassis to further reduce weight and the centre of gravity position, with the revised side-pods making the side impact structures smaller, but more efficient.
The seven speed gearbox is based on a revised version of the 2001 unit, although its internals have been re-packaged into a lower position with the casing optimised for stiffness. The car's cooling system has further been re-configured, making it lighter.
New regulations imposed by the FIA for 2002 have made the electrical power steering system illegal, prompting the team to design a new power assisted steering system for the EJ12.
In line with current F1 design philosophy, the front and rear suspension features pushrod-operated Penske dampers, while the EJ12 utilises Brembo brake calipers carbon fibre discs. With increased competition between tyre manufacturers, Jordan has opted to continue its successful partnership with Bridgestone, working closely with the Japanese company during the winter to develop new specification tyres."
McLaren MP4-17 Mercedes,"With only a few FIA Formula One regulation changes for the technical team to take into consideration, the MP4-17 is an evolution of last year's car. The main visible differences include changes to the front suspension area and rear bodywork. Aerodynamically, the car has been developed in the team's new, state-of-the-art wind tunnel facility, already in operation at the TAG McLaren Group's new headquarters and technology centre, which is currently under construction in Woking, UK.
In addition to the completely new Mercedes-Benz engine, the FO 110M, the switch to Michelin tyres has had a significant influence on the MP4-17's configuration, with tyres affecting the steering, aerodynamics and the balance of the car. The FO 110M V10 first ran on the dyno on 21st November 2001 and has since been extensively tested on the transient dynos in both Stuttgart and Brixworth.
The MP4-17 is the sixth car appearing in the distinctive West McLaren Mercedes colour scheme introduced at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix, which saw the first victory of the partnership. In the 83 Grands Prix since then, the team has secured 30 race wins, two Drivers' and one Constructors' World Championships."
Minardi PS02 Asiatech,"Minardi first debuted its 2002 Formula One challenger at the historic Circuit Enzo e Dino Ferrari, near the team's Faenza base, in eastern Italy. Less than a month later the team launched the PS02 for the second time in Malaysia. The new car is significantly different from its predecessor, the PS01, the most obvious external change being the shape. The PS02 benefits from the extensive experience of the team's chief aerodynamicist, Loic Bigois, and his technical staff, plus considerable time spent in wind tunnels at Casumaro, Italy, and Southampton, England. Compared with the 2001 car, the Minardi PS02 features a more raised nose section, reshaped and extended engine cover, and higher sidepods with different inlets. Beneath the curvaceous bodywork, there is an all-new 'floor', optimised to work in conjunction with the latest slim-line version of Minardi's unique, titanium-cased gearbox. In terms of mechanical layout, the most notable alteration to the 2002 car is the use of pushrod rather than pullrod-operated front suspension.
Also new for the 2002 season is the Asiatech AT02 V10 engine. Aside from being more powerful, it is also lighter and more compact than the unit it replaces, making it easier for the team's designers to accommodate all the necessary ancillaries around the engine. Additionally, it is more efficient in terms of cooling requirements."
Renault R202,"Renault returned to F1 as a team after an absence of over 15 years. When Renault,
createur d'automobile
, first entered F1 the one part of the car that stood out was the engine; Renault pioneered Turbo engines in F1. In 2002 the engine is special again, with a V angle of about 110 - 120 agrees it is over 20 degrees wider than the competitor's engines. A wider V angle results in a lower centre of gravity from which should improve handling by quite a bit. The wide-angle engine was introduced in the 2001 season in the Benetton and a season of development should have solved the teething problem the team was suffering from. The first Grand Prix of the season started promising with Jarno Trulli driving in second place after he crashed out."
Sauber C21 Petronas,"At the start of its 2002 campaign, Sauber is determined to defend its excellent fourth place in the 2001 FIA Formula One World Championship for Constructors. The C21 is a completely new car that evolved from the successful C20. The principal aim of the development programme carried out under the auspices of Technical Director Willy Rampf and his team has been to maintain the excellent consistency and performance of the C20 while achieving an improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, not just in terms of the most favourable ratio of downforce against drag, but also in areas such as engine cooling. At the same time, however, weight reduction, a lower centre of gravity, superior torsional rigidity and further optimisation of the engine and gearbox packaging were also priorities.
Sauber continues its commitment to young drivers. Nick Heidfeld, the 24 year-old German, is joined in his second season with the team by 20 year-old Brazilian Felipe Massa, the reigning Euro 3000 series champion."
Toyota TF102,"Toyota has taken a significant step on its path to Formula 1 with the unveiling in Cologne of its definitive 2002 challenger, the TF102. Official drivers, Mika Salo and Allan McNish, will give the car its race debut at the Australian GP at Melbourne on March 3.
Toyota Racing's F1 car, TF102, is a successor to the team's 2001 test car, TF101, and comes with a brand new livery. The car retains Toyota's corporate colours of red and white, whilst additionally carrying the logos of the team's newly acquired partners AOL Time Warner and Wella.
Toyota Racing is one of only two to produce its own chassis and engine under one roof, and is the first new entrant to do so since 1979. It is also the first Japanese manufacturer to compete in its own right since 1968.
The new car has been designed by a team led by Chief Designer Gustav Brunner, who joined Toyota in May, and overseen by Technical Manager of the chassis department, Dago Röhrer. The 2002 contender incorporates the lessons learned from this season's intensive testing programme.
The engine programme is managed by Norbert Kreyer, who has had the job of designing and developing the Toyota V10 from scratch. The 2002 race car is powered by newly developed engine, RVX-02. Since the launch of its test car in March 2001, the team has visited 11 of the current F1 venues worldwide, in addition to Toyota's home testing base at Paul Ricard in France. In the eight-month period to November 2001, the test cars had clocked up 20,967 kilometres or over 3,000 laps. In 2002, Toyota Racing will test with the new TF102, initially at Circuit Paul Ricard. The team also plans to participate in a joint test scheduled in Barcelona and will have its very first run with other teams. Intensive testing will resume in January 2002 with drivers Mika Salo and Allan McNish.
Just two and a half months remain until the opening race of the season, and it will be an extremely busy period as the test programme with the TF102 gets underway. However, all in the team are looking forward to the challenge of the first race weekend in Australia."
Williams FW24 BMW,"The starting point for the design of The FW24 was, in broad terms, twofold. Of primary consequence is any change to the fundamental technical parameters enforced by regulation updates for 2002. While a number of key areas will be affected by the new regulations, designers have not been forced to completely return to the drawing board in the same way that the move to narrower track width and grooved tyres demanded in 1998.
In the absence of wholesale regulation changes, the design team at WilliamsF1 did however have to embrace a completely new BMW engine, the P82, which in turn required the development of a new gearbox, and associated changes to the remainder of the drivetrain.
The P82 consists of almost 5,000 individual parts, around 1,000 of them different. All core components are developed and manufactured at BMW - such as the cylinder head, crankcase, crankshaft, camshaft or electronic engine management."
Arrows A22 Asiatech,For the 2001 F1 season the Arrows team used the Asiatech V10 engine (a rebadged Peugeot V10). With only one points finish for Verstappen the season was a disapointment for the Tom Walkinshaw run team. Halfway through the season Arrows stopped developing the A22 and started working on the 2002 contender. Arrows signed an engine deal with Cosworth for the 2002 season to replace the underpowered Asiatech engine.
BAR 003 Honda,BAR didn't improve much in their third season. The season was dominated by the battle with Jordan to be the highest ranked Honda supplied team. The battle was won by Jordan even though Jacques Villeneuve was the highest ranked Honda-powered driver.
Benetton B201 Renault,"The 2001 F1 season was the last season for the Benetton name in F1 after a presence of almost 20 years in the sport with two driver's and one constructor's championship under the belt. The team however will not disappear but it will fill two grid positions in the 2002 season under the name Renault.
The 2001 season was used mainly to experiment, especially the engine differt a lot from the rest of the field. Renault's V10 powerplant had a rumoured 111° V angle instead of the common 72° or 90° V angle used in other engines. The larger V angle has a lower centre of gravity in the car as a result which should benifit the handling of the car and furthermore the larger V angle allows for a higher maximum rpm and thus more horsepower. It looked like the winning package in theory but alas for the Benetton team there were some problems concerning the rigidity of the engine and the horizontal vibrations. The engine is a part of the chassis and if it is not rigid enough it will create chassis flex. Rigidity is not an issue with the compact engines normally used but the larger V angle didn't make the engine rigid enough. The larger V angle also creates in more horizontal vibrations as the pistons moved more horizontally than normal, this lead to many engine breakdowns and to be on the safe side the engine wasn't able to run at maximum rpm.
During the season the team worked on the problems and the last Grand Prix of the season the car became more competive. With full Renault backing and a new ingenious valve operating system the 2002 season saw Benetton/Renault back fighting for podium places."
Ferrari F2001,"The 2001 F1 season saw Ferrari copy the cleansweep of the 2000 season, dominating even more than in the previous season. Ferrari secured both titles with four races left in the season at the Hungaroring. Schumacher won 9 of the 17 races and clinched his 4th title. At the season's end he is the F1 driver with the most points (801) and most victories (53), Fangio is the only driver that has won 5 titles."
Jaguar R2,"The second season for the Jaguar team in F1 didn't start much better than the first season with many DNFs. A new aerodynamics package made the R2 more competitive, underlined by Irvine's third place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix. This unfortunately for Jaguar was a rare high, as Irvine only managed to finish in the points once after Monaco at the US Grand Prix. His team mate Pedro de la Rosa only managed to score one fifth and one sixth place. The 9 points scored were a mere 5 more than scored in the 2000 season by Jaguar."
Jordan EJ11 Honda,"For the second year running Jordan was not able to copy or better their 1999 result. The Jordan team did manage to beat the BAR team as being the best Honda powered team by two points. Team owner and manager Eddie Jordan was understandibly disapointed with the results and sacked Frentzen and replaced him with french veteran Jean Alesi. Jean Alesi, who started his F3000 career with Eddie Jordan, retired at the end of the season after 201 Grand Prix and one victory."
McLaren MP4-16 Mercedes,"Despite scoring seven wins, the McLaren MP4/15 had to settle for second in the 2000 Formula 1 World Championship behind Ferrari and Michael Schumacher. Looking to get back to the championship winning ways of 1998 and 1999, the Adrian Newey led engineering team developed the new MP4-16 for 2001.
The MP4-16 was built around a carbon-fibre monocoque chassis and featured push-rod actuated torsion-bar springs on all four corners. Ilmor once again supplied the Mercedes-Benz badged engines. Dubbed the FO110K, the latest iteration of the three-litre V10s were good for around 830 bhp. This power was transferred to the rear wheels through a McLaren seven-speed gearbox.
Going into their record breaking sixth season as team-mates, the McLaren driver line-up once again consisted of David Coulthard and Mika Häkkinen. The Finnish driver was the team leader as he had won the World Championship in 1998 and 1999 and finished runner-up in 2000. It was however, Coulthard, who drew first blood after finishing second at the season-opener in Australia and then winning the third round in Brazil.
During the remainder of the year, the McLaren team struggled to keep tabs on Ferrari and Williams. There were niggling issues with the aerodynamics and the Mercedes-Benz engine was not quite as powerful or reliable as the BMW and Ferrari V10s respectively. Coulthard scored one more win, in Austria, and late in the year Häkkinen scored victories in the British and American Grands Prix.
McLaren once again ended the year second in the standings but by a much larger margin. Coulthard placed second in the Drivers' Championship, well behind Schumacher. Häkkinen announced his retirement and was replaced by Kimi Räikkönen for the 2002 season.
With four wins, the McLaren MP4-16 was a successful Formula 1 car by most standards but it was overshadowed by the dominance of Ferrari and Schumacher."
Minardi PS01 Eurotech,"Before the 2001 season Minardi was in big financial problems and it looked like they were not going to make it to the grid of the first race. With less than two months to go Australian Paul Stoddart took over the team and made his European F3000 staff available for the Faenza team. The PS01 was tested only once before the Australian Grand Prix but both cars managed to qualify. The line-up consisted of the very talented Alonso who impressed by out-qualifying the more powerful Arrows and Benettons more than once. Minardi improved throughout the season but was not able to score points, yet."
Sauber C20 Petronas,One of the biggest surprises of the 2001 F1 season was the performance of the Sauber team. Both young drivers Heidfeld and Raikkonen impressed with their points scoring performances. The fourth place in the constructor's championship with 21 points. The performance in the first season of the then 21 year old Raikkonen earned him a spot in the McLaren team for the 2002 season.
Williams FW23 BMW,"The 2001 F1 season saw the Williams team return to winning form for the first time since the 1997 season, with victories scored by both drivers, Ralf Schumacher and rookie Juan Pablo Montoya. This was a result of the combination of the Williams FW23 chassis, BMW's V10 powerplant and the new Michelin tires. If Williams continue their recent form they will be fighting for the championship with their two very competent drivers."
Alfa Romeo Racing C39 Ferrari,"Sauber Motorsport AG, which manages and operates the Alfa Romeo Racing ORLEN team in the Formula One world championship, unveiled its 2020 contender, the C39, before the start of winter testing in Barcelona. The reveal of the car completes the grid, with Alfa Romeo Racing ORLEN being the final team to launch its livery ahead of the new season.
Race drivers Kimi Räikkönen and Antonio Giovinazzi, alongside reserve driver Robert Kubica and development driver Tatiana Calderon, pulled the covers off the C39 during a roll-out presentation in the pit lane at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.
The 2020 livery marks a further step forward over previous years, continuing with the themes and layout of the classic Alfa Romeo racing colors, but at the same time introducing an all-new look in terms of graphic effects. The theme of this new paintwork developed by Centro Stile is the “Speed-Pixel,” a graphic evocation of speed and time in the year of the brand’s 110th anniversary, something that also reflects the car’s advanced technology.
Compared to previous years, there is also a return to a simplified Quadrifoglio design and an enlarged Alfa Romeo script on the engine cover, which is now overlapping the main logo. Taking pride of place as always is Alfa Romeo’s iconic symbol that combines the cross from the city of Milan's ancient crest and the “Biscione” of the Visconti family, representing 110 years of glory and victories while looking to the future at the same time.
Designed and developed under the coordination of Technical Director Jan Monchaux, the C39 bears only a passing resemblance to its predecessor; it is, instead, a completely new concept aimed at helping the team build on the strong strides made in the last two years and continuing its progress toward the front of the grid.
The focus now switches to the crucial two weeks of testing in Barcelona. With just six days of on-track action ahead of the season opener in Melbourne, Australia, every hour of activity in Catalonia will be key to understanding the new car and extracting its potential.
For the time being, though, we can enjoy the looks of the Alfa Romeo Racing ORLEN C39. It really brings truth to the old adage of saving the best for last."
AlphaTauri AT01 Honda,"Ahead of the 2020 season, the Red Bull junior Grand Prix team morphed from Scuderia Toro Rosso to Scuderia AlphaTauri. The name used during the previous 14 seasons was abandoned in favour of the fashion brand founded by Red Bull in 2016. Along with the name change came a brand new livery that was revealed, just days before the official tests started, at what fittingly appeared to be a fashion show.
Apart from the new identity much has remained the same in the Faenza based team, who retained drivers Pierre Gasley and Danill Kvyat. The new-for-2020 AT01 was a development of the existing car as substantial rule changes are on the horizon. While some key components were developed together with Red Bull Racing, the engine was supplied by Honda."
Ferrari SF1000,"Ferrari’s 2020 challenger is called the SF1000, reflecting the fact that, at some point this season, the Scuderia will be the first team ever to take part in 1000 Formula 1 Grands Prix, in this the year that the top racing category celebrates its 70th anniversary. The SF1000, built entirely in Maranello, was launched tonight at the Romolo Valli Municipal Theatre in the town of Reggio Emilia. It was a gala evening that celebrated the marque’s Italian identity, in a setting that reflected the essence of Italy in terms of the national flag, art, architecture and music.
The evening began with a flashmob, to a musical soundtrack composed specifically for this event by Maestro Leonardo De Amicis, played by the orchestra of the Istituto Superiore di Studi Musicali di Reggio Emilia e Castelnovo ne’ Monti “Achille Peri – Claudio Merulo,” conducted by Sebastian De Amicis, as well as a set from DJ Benny Benassi. As the music ended, it was the turn of Ferrari CEO Louis Camilleri to speak, thanking everyone present for attending, including the town officials, the team partners and all those whose efforts will see this Ferrari perform on race tracks around the world.
The car’s unveiling was presided over by the Scuderia’s Team Principal and Managing Director Mattia Binotto, who recalled the words of the founder, Enzo Ferrari to sum up the emotions evoked by the Maranello marque: “Give a child a piece of paper and some crayons and ask them to draw a car and it will definitely be red.” Passion of course, but also innovation, research, team spirit and a will to compete; the qualities that are at the root of #essereFerrari, the hashtag coined last year that highlights the values of those who work for the Scuderia.
Once the covers had come off the SF1000, Binotto asked the two drivers, Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc to join him on stage. They both said they couldn’t wait to get behind the wheel! And the German and Monegasque will not have long to wait as the first day of official pre-season testing takes place at the Barcelona-Catalunya circuit, next Wednesday 19 February.
The Team Principal and drivers were then joined on stage for a group photo by Vice President Piero Ferrari and the President, John Elkann who closed proceedings with a few words, once again underlining the ties that bind the Prancing Horse and Italy itself. “We are proud to represent Italy around the world,” he said. “Even though Ferrari has won 238 of the 991 Formula 1 races run to date, our thirst for victory is stronger than ever. In the coming season, we will continue to face very tough opposition, but that only serves to spur us on to do more and to do even better. What distinguishes us is the amazing collective effort of everyone in Ferrari’s Gestione Sportiva, both on and off the track. That is our strength”."
Haas VF-20 Ferrari,"America's only Formula 1 team looked to bounce back from a disappointing and above all difficult season when it developed the new-for-2020 VF-20. As before, the engineering work was done at Dallara, while Ferrari served as the supplier of key components like the engine, gearbox and rear suspension. Retained for another season were drivers Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen."
McLaren MCL35 Renault,"McLaren Racing today unveiled the team’s 2020 F1 car, the MCL35, live from the McLaren Technology Centre to a global audience. Drivers Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris, who both enter their second season with the team, proudly presented the car ahead of it taking to the track for the first time during pre-season testing next week.
McLaren set to work on the MCL35, which is powered by the Renault E-Tech 20, during 2019 as the team pursued the first phase of its performance recovery programme. The season saw the team climb to fourth in the FIA Formula 1 Constructors’ World Championship and provided valuable insights for the development of the MCL35, in what will be an intensely competitive 2020 Formula 1 season.
The MCL35 continues to sport the striking McLaren papaya and blue, the original colours chosen by founder Bruce McLaren and representing the team’s 57-year legacy in the sport. The dynamic new livery is the essence of form and function; designed to further increase stand-out on the grid while being fully optimised for racing performance.
McLaren has also continued its positive commercial trend, with eight new partners for 2020, broadening the team’s partner family to 38 partners in total.
The MCL35 will make its official on-track debut during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain on 19 – 21 February and then again from 26 – 28 February. Carlos and Lando will share the driving duties across both tests."
Mercedes-Benz W11 EQ Performance,"The Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance is an evolution of last year’s contender – the car that won Mercedes its historic sixth consecutive double championship. The team has looked at a myriad of areas to improve the car and has changed the vast majority of the over 10,000 parts of the car to extract more performance. The Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance is expected to become the fastest Mercedes race car ever built.
“The regulations stayed largely the same for the new year, so for us it was all about trying to make sure that we don’t run out of development steam on a package that worked pretty well for us last year,” said James. “We wanted to change aspects of the concept of the car – aspects that would be completely impossible to change within a season – to give us a more fertile platform for the new season. We tried to make a few well-chosen architectural changes to keep the development slope strong even though the regulations are now a little bit longer in the tooth.”
In addition to many detail changes and smaller improvements, the team has introduced three larger changes – one at the front, one at the middle and one at the back of the car.
“At the front we have accepted more structural complexity around the uprights and wheel rims in order to provide a higher performance assembly overall,” said James. “In the middle of the car we have followed the pitlane trend by moving our upper side impact tube to the lower position and banking the aerodynamic gain that comes with this layout. At the rear of the car we have gone for an adventurous suspension layout in order to free up aerodynamic development opportunity. All three investments were improvements in their own right, but their real effect is to mobilize a raft of secondary aerodynamic gains both during the winter and, we hope, across the season to come.”
In 2019, the team brought a significant upgrade to the car after the first week of testing that changed the look of the Melbourne car quite significantly compared to the launch car. This year, the race trim will be much closer to the car that is running at Silverstone.
“We will still have upgrades for Melbourne that will come in the second week of testing, but the ‘entire new car’ approach of 2019 won’t feature,” said James. “Last year, the regulations were changed quite significantly, and they were decided quite late in the year. Under those circumstances, doing a launch car and a week two car gave us the chance to build the maximum amount of learning into our Melbourne car. With the regulations being more mature this year and with the opening stab of the 2020 development already being at the same level as the finish of last year’s car, repeating last year’s approach would not make sense.”"
Racing Point RP20 Mercedes,"For the team's second and final full season under the Racing Point F1 name, the new RP20 was launched ahead of the official tests. Designed by Andrew Green, it is an evolution of the existing RP19 as the rules remained largely the same from 2019 to the 2020 Formula 1 season. While drivers Sergio Perez and Lawrence Stroll have been retained, the team has a new title sponsor in BWT. For 2021, the Racing Point F1 name is set to be replaced by Aston Martin as the team will morph into a works effort."
Red Bull Racing RB16 Honda,"Building on the successful inaugural season with Honda, Red Bull Racing developed the RB16 for the 2020 Formula 1 World Championship. With a major rule change due for 2021, it is very much an evolutionary design of the three-time Grand Prix winning RB15 of 2019. So it once again combines the svelte Adrian Newey design with the Japanese turbocharged, hybrid V6 engine.
The RB16 broke cover the week before the official testing at Barcelona commenced. It was given a shakedown by Max Verstappen during a filming day at Silverstone."
Renault R.S. 20,"This year, Renault will continue its very proud and long-standing history in Formula 1 into a new decade, our sixth consecutive in the sport. We are in the midst of an interesting period, as we continue to engage within established global markets, while simultaneously developing our brand and its awareness in bigger areas like China and India within the widespread transformation of the automotive industry.
Our commitment to Formula 1 has led to inventive marketing initiatives to increase awareness of, and commitment to, our brand. I look forward in particular to supporting new activations from Groupe Renault and its markets around E-Tech technology, which has been inspired by long-standing Formula 1 innovation. Our presence in the sport is also a unique opportunity for the team’s partners and sponsors to build relationships with one of the most important car manufacturers in the world, and for Renault to benefit from their know-how in their respective fields.
2020 is also an important transition year for the team. We aim to recapture the positive momentum from our first three years since returning to Formula 1 while preparing for next season, which will represent a new cycle for all teams. Having completed our initial construction phase, we are more determined than ever to be ready to attack and take advantage of the 2021 technical changes.
2020 is also the last year under the current agreements that govern Formula 1’s commercial rights. The new agreements and rules, already in advanced negotiation, should represent a new opportunity for Renault Sport Racing and for Renault to take part in a more balanced, competitive sport.
I have every faith in the teams across Enstone and Viry to challenge once more for fourth in the Constructors’ Championship this year, plus ensure the coming era is anticipated successfully for both the team and Renault brand."
Williams FW43 Mercedes,"ROKiT Williams Racing has officially revealed its 2020 Formula One challenger, the Williams Mercedes FW43.
The FW43 is an evolution of the FW42, with much of the development work carried out throughout 2019 feeding in to the design of this year’s car.
Speaking ahead of the 2020 season, Claire Williams, Deputy Team Principal, said: “This year marks a fresh start for the team. We have spent time addressing our areas of weakness and have ensured that we have the right people, structures, procedures and resource in place to deliver competitive race cars. We are all committed to re-building Williams and returning the team to competitiveness. As such, our 2020 campaign is about making progress. The fighting spirit is still very much alive, and this year, everyone will continue that fight until we get back to where we want to be.”
Design Director, Doug McKiernan, commented: “The team at the factory have been working incredibly hard on the development of the car for the 2020 season.
“We have paid significant attention to understanding the problem areas of the FW42 and we have carefully chosen parts of the car to develop, those that would give us the most performance for the resources we have. The main concept behind the FW43 is that it is a continuous development of the FW42, with no fundamental concept changes to the layout. The most important indicator that we are on the right path will be the level of correlation we have between the tool kit we use to design the car and what the track data is telling us.
“There has been a healthy development rate in the wind tunnel, and we have found reasonable improvements in the cooling efficiency. The team has addressed the mechanical issues that affected it in 2019, these include the brakes and the overall weight of the car. We have made some good progress across these areas and will continue to focus on them during the season.”
Chief Engineer, Adam Carter, added: “The initiatives that we put in place to drive performance across all disciplines within the engineering department are evident in the design and development of the FW43. It’s been great to see the hard work starting to pay off.
“The decision to retain some of the core architecture of the FW42 means there has been less resource invested in developing new concepts, which in turn has rewarded the design team with greater bandwidth to optimise their work, evident in both packaging and component detail. By preserving some key parameters, it has allowed for an uninterrupted development programme within Aerodynamics in order to maximise the efficiency of the resources. As we head towards the pre-season tests and then onto the race season, the most important measure will be the progress relative to our peers, along with our intention of continuing our recent record of reliability.
“Later this week, we will be looking at our single timed lap pace, our long run pace and the feedback from the drivers to understand where we are and what we do next. We have teams, both at the track and back at Grove, that will be delving into all aspects that define that lap time during the pre-season tests to ensure we are in the best possible place ahead of the first race in Australia.”"
Alfa Romeo Racing C38 Ferrari,"Following a year as title sponsor, Alfa Romeo stepped up to take over the team name from Sauber in 2019. Although now operated as Alfa Romeo Racing, nothing changed behind the scenes as the new C38 was still developed at the Hinwil, Switzerland factory and powered by the latest Ferrari power unit.
Over the winter, much of the work concentrated on the subtle regulation changes. Aimed at making overtaking easier, the revisions included a wider but simpler front wing, lower bargeboards and a taller and wider front wing. The evolution of the C37 was created with oversight from new technical director Simone Resta.
Signed to drive the Alfa Romeo Racing C38 were Ferrari junior Antonio Giovinazzi and 2007 World Champion Kimi Raikkonen, who returned to the team where he started his Formula 1 career back in 2001."
Ferrari SF90,"The SF90 (design code 670) is the sixty fifth single-seater built by Ferrari to compete in the Formula 1 World Championship. The car has been produced based on the new regulations, which have required various changes compared to the 2018 car. Among the most obvious changes are those to the front and rear wings. The front wing is wider and boasts simpler aerodynamic profiles, while the rear is wider and higher. The bargeboards have been reduced in height, while the front brake duct design has been simplified. The overall weight of the car increases to 743 kilos, including the driver and his kit, which must weigh a minimum of 80 kilos. The fuel allowance for the race increases from 105 to 110 kg. The SF90 is the sixth car built for Formula 1's current hybrid era, which began in 2014.
The front wing is one of the most important components of the car, in that not only does it produce downforce at the front end, it also conditions the quality of airflow over the rear, which is a key factor in delivering effective aerodynamics. The 2019 regulations require a simplification of the front wing. Its width is increased to 2 metres, which is exactly the same as the track of the car, while the number of horizontal elements cannot exceed five. The vertical elements at the extremities of the wing are no longer allowed and the geometry of the endplates has been simplified. The purpose of these changes is to make the cars less sensitive to the outwash effect when following another car.
The brake ducts are a very important component on a Formula 1 car. They are designed to cool the carbon brake discs that can reach temperatures of over a thousand degrees Celsius. Over the years, the shape of the front air ducts has become extremely sophisticated and they have evolved to also play an aerodynamic role. In 2019, this is another component that has been simplified in the regulations.
Like the front wing, the rear has also been subjected to rule changes for 2019. It is higher by 70 millimetres, increasing from 800 to 870mm and wider, increasing from the previous 950 to 1050mm. The end plates are 100 mm longer and house the rear lights, which consist of a pair of LEDs at the outer edges of the rear wing, in a solution similar to the one already adopted by the FIA for LMP1 and LMP2 prototype cars. Rule changes also affect the Drag Reduction System (DRS,) which is now more effective.
The bargeboards are the side-mounted vanes that, on a current Formula 1 car help direct air flow to some specific areas of the car. Rules introduced for the 2019 season have limited the design options in this area, by reducing the area available to the designers. The maximum height for the bargeboards drops from 475 millimetres to 350 above the reference plane.
The 2019 Formula 1 regulations see the weight of the car increase by 10 kilos from 733 to 743kg. The fuel allowance for the race increases by 5 kg from 105 to 110. In addition, the minimum weight for a driver, including the equipment and seat is set at 80 kilos. For drivers who do not reach this minimum, their cars must take on ballast, which must be fitted in the cockpit area only.
The engine cover of the new Ferrari to be raced in 2019 is considerably narrower in order to improve the car's aero efficiency. Work on refining engine components and relocation of some of its ancillaries has led to a reduction in the space taken up, thus allowing for a much more compact bodywork design. This has the advantage of cleaning the airflow to the rear wing. The air intake now has a similar shape to that found on the 2016 car, while work on the fluid-dynamics inside the car means it has the same level of cooling efficiency as the SF71H, while taking up less space.
A Formula 1 Power Unit consists of six components. These are, the internal combustion engine - a 1.6 litre turbocharged V6; two motor generators, the MGU-K (Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic) and the MGU-H (Motor Generator Unit-Heat). The MGU-K is derived directly from the system known as KERS, which recovers kinetic energy under braking and stores that energy, up to a maximum of 4 MJ in the battery pack. As for the MGU-H, it recovers thermal energy from the turbo. Another element is the battery pack, where the recovered energy is stored until it is released. The sixth element is the electronic control unit. For the 2019, Ferrari 064 Power Unit, both the thermal and mechanical efficiency has continued to develop. This was achieved working on engine combustion, energy recovery and fluids. The Power Unit layout has been designed in symbiosis with the overall car design, while Energy Storage system reduced its weight and volume."
Haas VF-19 Ferrari,"Rich Energy Haas F1 Team unveiled its new-look for the 2019 FIA Formula One World Championship with a livery launch hosted at the prestigious Royal Automobile Club (RAC) on Pall Mall in London, while the design of its VF-19 challenger debuted online across the team's website and social media platforms.
Incorporating the resplendent black and gold colors of Rich Energy, the premium British energy drink first announced as title partner of Haas F1 Team in October 2018, the 2019 livery was revealed on a show car in London as drivers Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen, together with team principal Guenther Steiner and Rich Energy chief executive officer William Storey, peeled back the covers before a throng of assembled guests at the RAC.
In addition to the infusion of Rich Energy's branding, Haas Automation maintains its prominent placement on the VF-19, the familiar light gray tone associated with the three previous liveries have been carried over in the decals on its latest entry, one which will look to build on the success of the VF-18 which carried Haas F1 Team to a fifth-place finish in the 2018 constructors standings. The VF-19 continues to sport the branding of team partners JACK & JONES, PEAK, BlueDEF, Richard Mille, Alpinestars and Pirelli.
""This is the time of the season when you hope you've got designs right and you can be competitive straight away,"" said Gene Haas, founder of Haas Automation and chairman of Rich Energy Haas F1 Team. ""The new car looks distinctive, not only in terms of its color scheme, but also with the new regulations in play. Hopefully those design changes brought in for 2019 will improve the racing on-track, and more importantly give us a shot at making more of an impact at each Grand Prix.""
Team principal Guenther Steiner commented; ""It's important that we keep progressing as a team, and this season is no different. Our partnership with Rich Energy is another positive example of moving forward as an organization. We're pleased to see their colors on the VF-19, we welcome them as they join our valued partner group in utilizing Formula One as a global marketing platform. While 2018 delivered our best season to-date, the year showed, sometimes sharply, that we still have areas to improve on as a team. On-track, our push for performance started early with the VF-19, our next step is to get to Spain and utilize our time there wisely to prepare for Australia.""
""I'm naturally delighted to finally see the Rich Energy colors and stag logo in Formula One with Haas F1 Team,"" said William Storey, chief executive officer of Rich Energy. ""Partnering with the team has already significantly raised the profile of our brand, this livery unveil will again elevate us to another level. It's fantastic to see the VF-19 decked out in black and gold, with Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen similarly attired. We've worked closely with Haas F1 Team to ensure we present a strong look, one we're now very proud to take around the world competing in Formula One.""
The digital renderings of the VF-19, in addition to showcasing the team's new color scheme, also display the impact of the new season's regulation changes.
The simplified front-wing is evident, now 200mm wider and 20mm higher - designed to allow drivers to follow each other more closely and increase the possibility of overtaking. Similarly, the rear wing has been made simpler, as well as 20mm higher and 100mm wider, to aid slipstreaming and promote closer racing. Smaller, repositioned barge boards are also visible, reduced in height by 150mm and moved forward by 100mm, these have been designed to improve air flow from the front wing making them less aerodynamically disruptive."
McLaren MCL34 Renault,"McLaren Racing presented its first all-new Formula 1 driver line-up in 12 years, as Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris watched 34 of their McLaren team-mates unveil the MCL34, the team's 2019 race car, ahead of pre-season testing next week.
This year, Sainz (24) begins his fifth Formula 1 campaign, while Norris (19) embarks on his debut season, as McLaren continues its performance recovery programme throughout 2019.
The concept and design process of the 2019 McLaren MCL34, powered by the Renault E-Tech 19 engine, focuses on laying the foundations for development of the car throughout the season.
The MCL34 livery continues to sport the iconic McLaren papaya orange, echoing the colour chosen by Bruce McLaren for the team's first Formula 1 Grand Prix entry in 1966. This year's scheme is a progression from 2018, featuring a complementary blue that nods to the team's broader racing heritage.
Over a productive commercial pre-season, the team has continued to strengthen its partner portfolio, with the addition of three new brands forming a 30-strong roster.
The MCL34 will make its on-track debut during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain (18-21 February & 26 February - 1 March). Carlos and Lando will share the driving duties across both tests."
Mercedes-Benz W10 EQ Power+,"With a little over four weeks to go until the start of the 2019 FIA Formula One season, Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport today completed the first laps with its 2019 challenger. Named the Mercedes-AMG F1 W10 EQ Power+, the 2019 contender ran on the 2.98 km Silverstone International Circuit this morning with Valtteri Bottas behind the wheel, to be followed by Lewis Hamilton this afternoon.
Compared to its predecessor, the Mercedes-AMG F1 W10 EQ Power+ has been changed substantially. The majority of those modifications were driven by the significant changes to the Technical Regulations for the 2019 Formula One season.
""Regulation changes are both opportunity and threat,"" said Technical Director James Allison. ""They are an opportunity because all the old assumptions about what you need to have to be quick are swept away and, if you are fleet of foot and smart in dealing with that, you can do better than all the other teams that are tackling the same change. They are a threat because if you are not as smart and you didn't see how to make the most of these new regulations, then you'll certainly suffer in the coming season. But they are always exhilarating because you have that sharp sense of anxiety that you might not be doing enough but equally the thrill and excitement of looking forward to finding out.""
In addition to dealing with the changes to the aerodynamic regulations, which were the main focus in the development of the W10, the team worked hard to improve the weaker areas of the previous car and further build on its strengths.
""The handling of the W09 was a big improvement over the rather idiosyncratic W08,"" said James. ""We managed to be competitive at tracks which had plagued us in recent years. However, notwithstanding this improvement, we were still not as good as some of our competitors at preserving the performance of the rear tyres. We have worked hard on the suspension and aerodynamic characteristics to deliver a car that will be much kinder to its tyres - enough, we hope, to allow us to be competitive at all phases of the race and at each track on the calendar.
""Even though the minimum weight limit was lifted by 10kg for 2019, weight reduction remains a real challenge on the current generation of F1 cars. Components that we felt were stripped to the bone in 2018 have been taken, one by one, and subjected to a further round of aggressive analysis to shave further weight from them. Some components surrender what feels like a giant step of half a kilo, others just a few grams, but collectively each of these victories add up to a handful of kilos that have been invested back in the car on aerodynamics, suspension and Power Unit to bring performance.""
Despite significant changes to many areas of the car, the W10 also retains some of the characteristics of its predecessors, as the general architecture and the wheelbase stay the same.
""A close inspection will reveal that the execution of this concept has been further refined,"" said James. ""Every item is pushed tighter, made more slender - each change permitting us to improve the aerodynamic performance beyond what would have been possible had we accepted the physical limitations of the 2018 design.""
While the chassis development was partly driven by regulatory changes, the Power Unit regulations remained largely stable, making the development work more of an evolutionary process in which the team worked hard to achieve two main goals - improving performance and reliability.
""We've made changes to the cooling architecture of the Power Unit, which hopefully provide aerodynamic benefit on the car and also provide efficiency benefit on the Power Unit - so, hopefully a win on both the chassis and on the Power Unit,"" said Andy Cowell, Managing Director of Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains. "" Right at the heart of the Power Unit is the conversion of fuel into heat release in the combustion chamber and useful work out of the crankshaft. We have made steps on the combustion efficiency and on the ERS system. The marriage between the turbocharger assembly with the MGU-H, the inverter, the cells and the MGU-K: that whole system is now capable of operating more efficiently and helping with energy deployment through a race.""
The team's title partner PETRONAS played an important role in the hunt for improved performance and reliability, especially in the development of the new Power Unit.
""The fuel is right at the heart of the combustion and making sure that the chemical composition and the thermodynamic architecture of the Power Unit are working together exceptionally well is key to thermal efficiency,"" said Andy. ""PETRONAS have continued to work well with our thermodynamic engineers, we've run many candidates on the single cylinder and on the V6 engine to derive a new fuel for 2019. It's a very tight-knit group, the PETRONAS engineers know exactly how the engine works and our Power Unit engineers know exactly how the fuel works. PETRONAS also provide the lubricants for our car which play two roles: to make sure that components don't contact, it's key that there is an oil film between highly loaded components both for reliability and for friction reduction. If you can keep components apart the friction is lower, and the wear is lower, but the lubricant also provides cooling within the engine. It's a critical element of the engine, it's the lifeblood of the engine for its survival.""
The maximum race fuel allowance has increased by 5 kilograms to a total of 110 kilograms. However, the higher fuel allowance does not impact the thermal efficiency of Formula One Power Units, which are among the most efficient engines ever-built.
""If you have got an efficient engine with efficient aerodynamics and you are prepared to do a little bit of lift and coasting, then you have the opportunity to start the race at less than 110kg,"" explained Andy. ""For every 5kg of weight you save, it's about two tenths of a second a lap quicker, so there is a natural reward to starting the race a little bit lighter. There is still a competitive edge from making an efficient car - both Power Unit and aerodynamics - and racing smartly to make sure that you have good pace at the start of the race as well as through the race."""
Racing Point RP19 Mercedes,"During a tumultuous 2018 season, the Force India Formula 1 team changed hands and re-emerged in 2019 as Racing Point F1. The new owner was a consortium headed by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll. Accordingly, it came as no surprise that one of the two Racing Point drivers for the new year was Stroll's son Lance. He joined long-time Force India driver Sergio Perez.
The car built for Stroll and Perez to race was dubbed the Racing Point RP19 and it finally broke cover at the first of two four-day test sessions at Barcelona. It was instantly recognisable as an evolution of the 2018 car with most modifications made to meet the revised regulations that stipulate a simpler front wing and a taller and wider rear wing. The team is expected to bring out a comprehensive update at the first Grand Prix of the year in Australia."
Red Bull Racing RB15 Honda,"Sporting a one-off livery, the new-for-2019 Red Bull Racing RB15 broke cover at a special filming day less than a week before official testing was set to commence. Significantly, this is the very first Red Bull Grand Prix car in over a decade that is not powered by Renault-built engine as the team decided to switch to the Honda power unit. In addition to the changes in the engine department, the RB15 has also taken into account the revised aerodynamics regulations aimed at making overtaking slightly easier. Another major change for the 2019 season is that Max Verstappen is now partnered with Pierre Gasly. Thelatter raced for junior team Toro Rosso in 2018 and as such already has experience with the Honda engine."
Renault R.S. 19,"Renault F1 Team unveiled its 2019 team colours and star driver line-up of Nico Hülkenberg and Daniel Ricciardo.
Images revealed of 2019 challenger, the Renault R.S.19, showcasing revised aerodynamic regulations.
The Renault R.S.19 will be powered by the renamed Renault E-Tech 19 power unit, reflecting greater synergies with the Renault hybrid range.
Renault showcased its regenerated technical centre at Enstone, UK.
Renault F1 Team is proud to be supported by premium partners including BP Castrol, Infiniti, MAPFRE and RCI Banque, but also Microsoft, EURODATACAR, Bell&Ross, Tmall and many valued technical partners."
Toro Rosso STR14 Honda,"The first new 2019 specification Grand Prix car to break cover was the Toro Rosso STR14. Built to meet the latest aerodynamics regulations aimed at improving overtaking, it is once again powered by the Honda power unit and features a rear end shared with sister team Red Bull Racing. Tapped to drive for the Scuderia Toro Rosso team in 2019 are Daniil Kvyat and Alexander Albon."
Williams FW42 Mercedes,"Williams Racing were keen to bounce back from the team's worst season in its 40-year history at the start of the 2019 season. For this, the new FW42 was conceived over the winter under the auspices of Paddy Lowe, who had previously designed successful Grand Prix cars for Mercedes-Benz and McLaren.
With most of the technical regulations carried over from the previous season, it was no surprise that the FW42 design was evolutionary in nature. The rules that did change mostly covered the aerodynamics with an eye on making overtaking easier. So the FW42 featured a wider yet simpler front wing and a taller, wider rear wing.
Williams Racing continued their partnership with power unit supplier Mercedes-Benz. Arguably the most potent of all engines, the hybrid V6 was mated to a Williams-built eight-speed automatic gearbox.
What did change was the arrival of seasoned Polish racer Robert Kubica, who finally made his comeback as a full-time Formula 1 driver after his massive rally accident in 2011. He was joined behind the wheel by the hugely talented George Russell, fresh from his 2018 Formula 2 title winning campaign.
Unfortunately, Williams failed to hit the ground running in 2019 as the time had to sit out most of the vital opening test week while awaiting the arrival of the FW42 in the Barcelona paddock. The new Williams finally made it onto the track on the third day of the four-day test."
Ferrari SF71H,"The SF71H (the code name for the 669 project) is the sixty fourth single-seater car designed and produced by Ferrari to compete in the Formula 1 World Championship. Rule changes introduced last season led to the introduction of significant aerodynamic modifications and wider tyres, all aimed at increasing performance. Therefore the new 2018 Ferrari F1 car has been created to make the most of the experience gained last year. Compared to 2017's SF70H, the wheelbase has been changed slightly, with the side dimensions also revised along with the cooling system. The suspension follows the tried and tested practice of using push-rods at the front and pull-rods at the rear, however, their design has been updated based on experience gained during the first season running the wider tyres.
The most obvious element to catch the eye is the Halo, designed to protect the cockpit area. After two years of on-track testing, it has now entered the rule book. It weighs around 7 Kg, plus fittings and this has only been partly compensated for with an increase of 5 Kg - from 728 to 733 - to the minimum car weight set in the 2018 regulations.
The number of V6 engines that can be used over the course of the season, without incurring a penalty, continues to decrease, this year from 4 to 3. The same number applies to the turbo-compressor and MGU-H - the energy recovery system attached to the turbo - while only 2 MGU-K -the device that generates kinetic energy linked to the transmission - are allowed over the year, a figure which also applies to the electronic control unit and the batteries. Therefore those in the engine department have also based their work on these new parameters.
After it's launch on Thursday 22nd February, the SF71H will be transported to Barcelona's Catalunya Circuit, for a filming day on Sunday 25th, followed by the start of testing proper on Monday 26th. The first session runs to the end of Thursday 1st March, while the second test takes place at the same circuit from 6th to 9th March. Both Scuderia Ferrari race drivers, Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel will be driving."
Force India VJM11 Mercedes,"The covers came off the VJM11 in Barcelona to reveal a new gloss livery incorporating the pink, magenta and silver of Austrian water specialists, Best Water Technology (BWT).
Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon were on hand to conduct car presentation duties giving the media and fans a chance to see the team's 2018 challenger for the first time. Nikita Mazepin joined the race drivers for a photo call alongside Chief Operating Officer, Otmar Szafnauer, and Technical Director, Andrew Green.
The updated livery offers a more dynamic look for the team and builds on the strength of the pink identity that was introduced in 2017.
Otmar Szafnauer, was the first to praise the fresh new look: ""The VJM11 certainly looks eye-catching in its new livery. We worked very closely with BWT to deliver an even stronger identity for the car this year and everybody is really happy with the result. The new shade of pink is very striking and really pops out.""
The VJM11 was presented with new logos from petroleum brand, PEMEX, on the wing mirrors, while the team's new lubricants partner, RAVENOL, displays its logo on the bargeboards. The engine cover sees branding from NEC as the Japanese ICT specialists extend their partnership with the team for a fourth year.
The long-standing partnerships with Claro, Infinitum and TelCel, continue in 2018 with all three brands prominently displayed on the VJM11. Similarly, the team's relationship with Hype continues for a fourth season with branding on the nose and roll hoop, while long-term partner, Kingfisher, takes up a position on the engine cover and reverse of the rear wing. Branding from Industrial Engineering brand DUO is positioned on the car's rear crash structure.
As well as new colours, the shape of the VJM11 will evolve considerably during the next month, as Andrew Green explains: ""The DNA of the car is still very much that of last year's car. We took the decision, quite a while ago, that the launch specification of the 2018 car would be based around our understanding of the 2017 car, but with all new structures required by the regulations in place. It is a starting point, a good reference from which to introduce changes quite quickly; it gives our aerodynamics department more time to develop a car for the first race in Australia, rather than having to release parts early for testing.""
After two consecutive fourth place championship finishes, the team remains determined to consolidate its position in 2018, as Team Principal, Vijay Mallya explains: ""I see no reason why we cannot consolidate our position and improve. Yes, Formula One is a very tough and competitive environment, but we are an established team with continuity in all areas of the company. We don't take anything for granted, but we will be disappointed if we are not fighting for points at every race this year."""
Haas VF-18 Ferrari,"Haas F1 Team's 2018 challenger in the FIA Formula One World Championship, the VF-18, made its official debut via the organization's social media platforms and website.
The VF-18 is an evolution of the team's second car, the VF-17, which carried Haas F1 Team to an eighth-place finish in the 2017 constructors standings. Forty-seven points were scored by the VF-17 during Haas F1 Team's sophomore season, 18 points more than the total earned in the organization's debut season in 2016.
Incorporating ""VF"" into the name of the car is a nod to the history of Haas Automation, the team's title sponsor. The first CNC machine manufactured by Haas Automation was the VF-1 in 1988. The ""V"" stands for vertical, which is an industry standard designation for a vertical mill. Gene Haas, founder of Haas Automation, added ""F1"" to the name to unofficially designate it as the company's ""Very First One"".
As chairman of Haas F1 Team, the ""F1"" moniker of that first machine has taken on added significance as Haas utilizes Formula One to build Haas Automation into a premium, global brand.
""People see what we can do in Formula One and people believe Haas Automation can build world-class machine tools,"" said Haas, whose entry in 2016 became the first American Formula One team since 1986. ""Being a Formula One participant brings a level of credibility that you just won't get through traditional advertising.""
Haas has built Haas Automation into the largest machine tool manufacturer in North America by focusing on the details amid constant refinement. He has applied those same attributes to Haas F1 Team.
""We eliminated a lot of the variables where we knew we were weak,"" Haas said. ""We've focused on what it's going to take to get our car to be consistent and close that gap to the top teams.""
Beyond refinement, the VF-18 carries the significant addition of the halo and a drastic reduction in the sharkfin.
""The biggest part of the car's evolution was the addition of the halo,"" said Guenther Steiner, team principal, Haas F1 Team. ""It took quite a bit of study by the aerodynamicists, but the designers had to work hard to modify the chassis so the halo could survive the mandated loads. The total minimum weight of the car increased because of the halo, and there's a higher center of gravity simply because of the halo's position. But, everyone is in the same boat.
""The regulations stayed pretty stable between 2017 and 2018, so the VF-18 is an evolution of our car from last year. It's less about reinvention and more about refinement. You see elements we had from last year on the car this year.
""Our 2017 car was actually pretty good, but we didn't always get the best out of it, and that's what we aimed to change in 2018. We got the car as light as possible to carry more ballast. We were able to do a better job of putting the weight where we wanted it.""
The corporate colors of Haas Automation were carried over to the VF-18. Gray makes up the majority of the livery, augmented with tones of red and black that incorporates the look of Haas Automation's complete line of vertical and horizontal machining centers, turning centers and rotary tables and indexers. Approximately 1,300 employees encompass Haas Automation, with the Oxnard, California-based company exporting its machines to more than 60 countries. The VF-18 showcases Haas Automation's commitment to technology and innovation to a passionate, global audience.
""The livery is a little bit of a return to what we had on our first car, the VF-16,"" Steiner added. ""Its look is clean and precise, just like the machine tools made by Haas Automation.""
The VF-18 tests at Circuit de Barcelona - Catalunya Feb. 26-March 1 and again March 6-9 before the season-opening Australian Grand Prix March 25 in Melbourne."
McLaren MCL33 Renault,"The striking MCL33 will contest the 2018 FIA Formula 1 World Championship, and marks the first time in McLaren's 52-year history that it has run a car powered by Renault engines.
The car will race in a stunning new livery that draws its inspiration directly from the team's iconic papaya orange and blue colour scheme that McLaren first raced in Formula 1 50 years ago. The MCL33 will be driven by Spain's Fernando Alonso, the F1 double world champion entering his fourth consecutive season with McLaren, and his team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne of Belgium, who is starting his second season in Formula 1.
The engineering philosophy of the MCL33 follows the roots established by its predecessor, with data accumulated from the 2017 season feeding a range of improvements. Much of the work on the MCL33 has been around optimising the packaging of the new Renault engine, and the incorporation of the new halo device.
The MCL33 will conduct a dynamic filming day at a Spanish test track on Friday before beginning eight days of pre-season testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya next Monday.
Technically, the McLaren MCL33 is a logical development of last year's car.
But it's been developed and refined with the benefit of a year's experience with the current regulations.
""With last year's car, we had to commit to certain decisions about architecture based on what we knew at the time,"" says Tim Goss, McLaren's Chief Technical Officer - chassis. ""With a year of track learning behind us, we've used that understanding to adjust some architectural decisions. That means we've been able to revise all the sorts of things you bake into the chassis at the start of the year.""
""We're definitely continuing along the same trajectory,"" continues Goss. ""For launch, the car will look evolutionary, and we will continue enhancing the MCL33 through testing and the race season.
In terms of development, the design team has focused on refining the package; making it neater, simpler and more elegant.""
""That's always been an area of focus for us,"" says Goss. ""But, this year, we went beyond to get a neat and tidy packaging solution. And that just gives the aerodynamicists more scope to play with the bodywork."""
Mercedes-Benz W09 EQ Power+,"With only a little over a month to go until the first race of the 2018 FIA Formula One season, Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport today took the wraps off the all new Mercedes-AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+.
Team partners, guests and media joined the team for the reveal show at Silverstone, while Mercedes fans around the world took part in the action and watched the unveiling of the new F1 challenger live online. For one fan in particular, shakedown day turned out to be a once in a lifetime experience. Having won the team's launch contest, he and his stepdaughter were invited for a VIP experience on-site at Silverstone. The main reveal show paid tribute to Mercedes' long motorsport history, featuring emotional footage of some of the team's most painful defeats and most thrilling victories.
As the most advanced machine ever conceived by Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport, the 2018 car aims to write its own chapter in that long racing heritage while at the same time pushing the technological boundaries of motorsport. The F1 W09 EQ Power+ is improved in every area over its predecessor and will become the fastest Mercedes Formula One car in history.
Christened Mercedes-AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+, the new car proudly carries the ""EQ Power+"" designation which was launched to the world on last year's car. As part of the naming strategy of Mercedes-AMG, ""EQ Power+"" stands for the brand's future performance hybrid models. The Formula One team is proud to have led the way that was followed by the Mercedes-AMG Project ONE show car revealed in Frankfurt last year. The EQ Power+ designation places the F1 car and its state-of-the-art hybrid power unit at the forefront of the future Mercedes-AMG line-up, showcasing how F1 technology is accelerating the future of motor racing and automotive technology in general.
The launch was part of the team's official 100 km filming day, during which the F1 W09 EQ Power+ completed its first laps of Silverstone's 2.98 km International Circuit with Valtteri Bottas behind the wheel. Lewis Hamilton's run in the car is scheduled for the early afternoon."
Red Bull Racing RB14 Tag Heuer,"Daniel Ricciardo is taking the all-new Aston Martin-Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer RB14 for a spin at Silverstone as we conduct a pre-season filming day.
The RB14 is currently wearing a special edition livery. We're keeping our race-ready paint job under wraps for the time being and will unveil it at the Circuit de Catalunya next week. The unfamiliar shapes under the paint, however, are here to stay.New bodywork regulations always dominate the news cycle in the launch season - but 2018 has a bigger acreage of change than most years with the introduction of the Halo and the new exclusion zones on the rear of the car that effectively remove shark fins, monkey seats and T-wings. Some years it's difficult for the casual viewer to differentiate the new car from the old: that isn't going to be a problem this time around.
That said, the technical regulations haven't changed hugely for 2018. Installing the Halo has been a challenge - mostly in terms of building a chassis strong enough to accommodate it and pass a brutal homologation test - but the rest of the regs have been comparatively stable. That's the primary reason we're able to launch earlier than usual.
The pattern of the last few years has been to launch 'aggressively late'. This has allowed the design department the maximum amount of time to add goodness to the car before the cut-off point at which the design is frozen and a launch car produced. It's been not uncommon to have the car finished, fired up for the first time and shipped to Spain for the start of testing all on the same day.
It serves a purpose - but you wouldn't do it if you didn't have to, and this year we didn't have to. It's preferable to finish the car early and deal with any snags now, when the car is on a track a short drive from the factory, rather than using up one of our eight ultra-precious test days doing the same at the Circuit de Catalunya.
We'll be filming at Silverstone and the footage will give fans an early-season fix across our channels before testing proper begins next week. Alongside the formal group tests, teams are allowed to conduct two of these promotional events each year, within strict guidelines that limit running to 100km and mandate the use of a specific tyre compound developed by Pirelli for this type of running.
Basically, Daniel's not going to be setting any records at Silverstone - but it's an incredibly valuable exercise nonetheless."
Renault R.S. 18,"Fans of the Renault Sport Formula One Team were able to get a close-up look of the 2018 season challenger today as the Renault R.S.18 was unveiled. Using specially-created tools, fans could see a stunning hologram projection of the car and spin it through 360 degrees to see its brand-new lines and new black and yellow livery.
The Renault R.S.18 is Renault Sport Formula One Team's third chassis since its return to Formula 1 as a full works' entry in 2016. The car is a progression and refinement of the concepts developed during the 2017 season. It includes an improved suspension concept and greater aerodynamic downforce. Noticeably, the R.S.18 also features the mandatory new-for-2018 cockpit protection known as the 'halo' and a re-profiled engine cover to comply with the 2018 technical regulations.
The 1.6l turbocharged V6 Renault R.E.18 power unit will power the R.S.18. The power unit has realised a very strong programme on the dyno in Viry-Chatillon to maximise performance and improve reliability in preparation for the reduction to just three internal combustion engines (ICE) and two MGU-K and energy stores per season.
The R.S.18 is developed jointly by the teams in Enstone, UK, and Viry, France. Significant improvements have been made to the Enstone facility over the past year, with enhancements to the CFD supercomputer, wind tunnel, race team operations room, gearbox dyno, machine shop and an expanded design office. The upgrades have already translated into on-track performance, with Renault Sport Formula One Team finishing the season sixth in the Constructors' Championship, improving from ninth in 2016."
Sauber C37 Ferrari,"The Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 Team has launched its new challenger, the C37, ahead of the 2018 Formula 1 championship.
The C37 looks different to last year's C36 - on one hand, this is due to the new technical regulations, and on the other hand, because of the team's new technical approach.
As the 2018 season is about to kick off, Frédéric Vasseur, Team Prinicpal, says: ""I am very much looking forward to the 2018 season, and to seeing Marcus (Ericsson) and Charles (Leclerc) on track. We have put lots of effort and hard work into the C37 over the last few months, and it is fantastic to be launching the new car today. I am convinced that Marcus and Charles form the perfect driver line-up, with one being an experienced driver and one a promising rookie. Marcus is going into his fourth season with us. He is a valuable part of the team, and we benefit from his experience and precise technical feedback. As for Charles, he has proven his talent in prior categories and deserves to be on the Formula 1 grid this season.""
""Our target ahead of 2018 is clear: We have to catch up with the field and continue improving our performance during the course of the season. We have put lots of energy and commitment into the development of the C37. I want to thank our partners and fans for their continuous support. The return of Alfa Romeo to Formula 1 sets another milestone in the team's history, and I am proud that such a historical brand has chosen us for their return to the sport. We are eager to start the 2018 season as the Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 Team,"" Vasseur continues.
Alfa Romeo's comeback restores one of the great names that have gone down in the history of motorsport's premium championship, Formula 1, and marks the return of the ""Quadrifoglio"", the legendary badge that has appeared on Alfa Romeo's top performance cars since 1923, to the circuits. Featured on the engine cover of the new C37, the famous good-luck charm has a fascinating history, deeply rooted in the racing world. The first Alfa Romeo car to carry the Quadrifoglio was the ""RL"" driven by Ugo Sivocci which won the 15th edition of the Targa Florio in 1923. The same good-luck emblem also appeared on Brilli Peri's ""P2"" when he triumphed in the first ""Motor Racing World Championship"" in Monza in 1925, gaining the first of Alfa Romeo's five World Titles, and it was present again in 1950 and 1951, when Giuseppe ""Nino"" Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio drove the Alfa Romeo 158 and 159 cars, the famous ""Alfettas"", to success in the first two Formula 1 World Championships. Today, the legendary symbol returns to the highest level of motor racing to show the whole world the continuing strength and success of the Alfa Romeo philosophy, a constant search for excellence applied to racing, then transferred in its entirety to the brand's production cars. The legend continues.
Jörg Zander, Technical Director, explains: ""It is great to finally reveal the C37 today. The 2018 challenger is the result of the hard work that everyone in the factory has put in over the last few months. Speaking about the C37, the car philosophy is much different to that of the C36. The aerodynamic concept has changed significantly, and the C37 has several new features in comparison to its predecessor. We are positive that the new concept offers us more opportunities and will help us to make improvements during the course of the season. The 2018 Ferrari engine will also give us a boost in terms of our performance. We hope that we will make progress with the C37 and that we are more competitive compared to 2017.""
The official rollout of the C37 will take place on the occasion of the first winter tests at the Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona from the 26th of February to the 1st of March 2018."
Toro Rosso STR13 Honda,"Compared to a year earlier, it was all change for the Toro Rosso team going into the 2018 season. The all-new STR13 featured a different engine and gearbox compared to the car raced a year early, while the team also boasted a new driver line-up compared to the start of the previous season. Brendon Hartley and Pierre Gasley did, however, drive the STR12 during the second half of the 2017 season.
What was all new for the STR13 was the Honda drivetrain, which was previously used with little luck by the McLaren team. Like all 'power units', Honda's consists of a turbo-charged V6 engine combined with sophisticated electric motors that harvest power both through braking and from the turbo. In previous seasons, the Honda unit proved neither reliable or powerful enough to challenge the rivals but Toro Rosso took a leap of faith, also in part to sample the engine for the senior Red Bull Racing team.
With regulations remaining virtually unchanged, the STR13 was an evolution of the STR12 with most changes made to accommodate the new engine. The most substantial change was the need for a brand new eight-speed gearbox. Designed and built over the winter, it was developed by the team faster than any previous gearbox. The most obvious visual change was the adaptation of the 'HALO' head protect system.
Unveiled at the start of the first of a pair of four-day test sessions at Barcelona, the Honda-engined STR13 was one of the big surprises. Not only were the times representative, the Toro Rosso machine actually completed the most laps, suggesting the reliability issues were at least somewhat cured."
Williams FW41 Mercedes,"WILLIAMS MARTINI RACING has revealed a first look of its 2018 Formula One challenger, the Williams Mercedes FW41, at the team's season launch in London.
The FW41 looks significantly different to its predecessor, the FW40, following input from the team's Chief Technical Officer, Paddy Lowe, and Head of Aerodynamics, Dirk de Beer, who were both appointed at the beginning of last year, to join forces with Chief Designer Ed Wood.
Speaking ahead of the 2018 season, Claire Williams, Deputy Team Principal, said: ""I am thrilled to be back and launching our new car, for a new season, with a new, exciting driver line-up. For many months, the team have put a tremendous amount of effort into the FW41 and I'm eager to see both Lance and Sergey take to the track later this month.
""Lance produced some impressive performances last year in what was a remarkably strong debut season, where he only just lost out to Felipe in the standings. His podium finish was the only one outside of the top three teams, and we aim to build on that this season.
""It's also my pleasure to welcome Sergey and Robert to Williams, who have both displayed exceptional speed and qualities that I know will only strengthen the team. Sergey has impressed the technical team and it is great for us to be able to give him the opportunity to step up into a race seat. Robert, will also be working closely with the team, utilising his experience to help develop the car throughout the season.
""Our entire team have put a huge amount of effort into the development and production of this year's car, and we're all looking forward to seeing it on the track. I would also like to thank our partners and fans for all their confidence and support.""
Chief Technical Officer, Paddy Lowe, added: ""It is very exciting to be giving everyone the first look at the FW41. It is the product of some great teamwork across the various functions in the organisation including aerodynamics design, vehicle dynamics, race engineering and systems engineering. The car has many new features, most of which are not all that obvious, but externally the team has pursued a very different aerodynamic concept which has allowed us some significant progress in aerodynamic performance. All Formula One cars are an evolution of what has gone before to some extent, but the FW41 does involve a number of departures from the directions that have been pursued in the past. Overall, the philosophy we are starting to see emerge is a new approach to the collaboration between aerodynamics and design to achieve the optimum working result. Aerodynamics, structure and weight are the three major trades to be made in designing a Formula One car, and all the work, alongside a number of radical changes to the car's packaging to incorporate further developments from Mercedes HPP, have led us to the FW41 being revealed today. We hope that this car will make progress in the performance rankings relative to 2017. The whole technical team is also feeling very positive about our two talented young race drivers with the combination of Lance and Sergey, alongside the contribution of Robert as our reserve and development driver.""
In his debut Formula One season, Lance broke two records by becoming the youngest rookie podium finisher with a third-place finish at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, as well as becoming the youngest front-row starter, after securing second on the grid for the Italian Grand Prix. In 2018, Lance enters his second season with Williams, and commented, ""Ahead of every new season there is a lot of anticipation and unanswered questions and this makes it even more exciting. With a season under my belt with the team, I can't wait to get back on track and see what the new car is like. Until we are on track we will not know what the competition has been doing, but I am very excited and optimistic about the car the team has built. Last year was a steep learning curve for me and now I can't wait to see what 2018 has in store.""
Making his Formula One race debut in 2018, Williams' new recruit Sergey Sirotkin said: ""I feel really excited ahead of the season. I've spent a lot of time at the factory, I'm almost living there at the moment which has been great motivation for me and for all of the people around the factory. It's been a big enjoyment to start working properly with all the mechanics and engineers, and it's going well. I've been training hard and I've been in the simulator regularly, going through different set-ups with the car, different tracks, seat fittings and also a lot of engineering meetings and factory tours to meet everyone. I've been having fun with all the guys from different departments. It's busy times, but I am really enjoying it. I'm getting ready for the season in the best possible way.""
In 2018, Robert Kubica makes his return to Formula One as Williams' Reserve and Development Driver, adding: ""I'm back in Formula One in a different role to when I was racing in 2011, but I'm back permanently in the F1 paddock, so I'm looking forward to it. It will be interesting to go back to some of the places I have been before, some of them providing different emotions from different moments in my life. Sometimes it can be quite difficult watching others racing, but I have a different role this year. It's sure to be a tough season with a lot of races and things to do. I have to be on top of the work I have to do for the team. So, let's get started!""
The FW41 will take to the track for the first day of the Barcelona test on Monday 26th February for eight days of testing, concluding on 9th March. The season officially begins at the first race in Melbourne, Australia, on 25th March."
Ferrari SF70H,"The 63rd single-seater designed and built by Scuderia Ferrari to take part in the Formula 1 World Championship is born out of a regulation change that is without precedent in this category of motor sport. Generally, in the past, regulations went in the direction of slowing down the cars. However, this year, the rule changes go in the opposite direction, meaning the cars have more aerodynamic downforce and more mechanical grip.
On this topic, the Gestione Sportiva group has concentrated its efforts on finding the right compromise between downforce and aerodynamic resistance, or drag. The new Pirelli tyres are much wider than in the past, by 6 centimetres each at the front and 8 at the rear. This increased frontal area constitutes a ""brake"" on forward motion as does the increased downforce coming from the 2017 specification front wing, floor and diffuser. Countering this effect, the combination of downforce and the bigger footprint from the tyres translates into increased grip, leading to higher cornering speeds.
There are several differences between the SF70H and Ferraris from the recent past: the lengthened nose and the arrow-shaped wing are a consequence of the regulations, as is the obvious fin on the engine cover and the more complex aero appendages ahead of the air intakes on the sidepods, whose unusual shape was designed in harmony with the front crash structure. Visible at the front is a duct that has an aerodynamic role, while behind the driver, the roll-hoop, which incorporates the engine air intake has been completely redesigned. Also updated is the suspension layout, which still retains a push rod design at the front with pull rods at the rear. The hubs and wheel nuts have been redesigned to facilitate the work of the mechanics when changing wheels during the pit stops. Finally, also as a function of the expected increase in performance this year, the power-steering and braking systems have been upsized.
In contrast to the aerodynamics, when it comes to the power unit, there have been few changes to the regulations. The main one concerns the amount of fuel that can be used by each car during the race: with the predicted increase in performance, with a bigger percentage of each lap spent at full revs, the permitted amount of fuel has increased from 100 to 105 Kg, although the flow rate is still fixed at 100 kg/hour. The 062 engine is a definite step forward compared to its predecessor, when it comes to chasing performance. The layout of some of the mechanical components on the hybrid power unit has been revised, while other areas maintain a similar layout to the 2016 car. On the sporting regulation front, the abolition of the ""Token"" system allows the teams more room for development over the course of the season."
Force India VJM10 Mercedes,"Sahara Force India launched its 2017 season offering fans and media their first look at the team's new car, the VJM10. Silverstone circuit was the venue as Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon pulled back the covers to reveal the team's dynamic new look including an updated livery and expanded partner portfolio.
The VJM10's new aerodynamic package is guaranteed to get heads turning, while the silver and orange livery retains the team's traditional colours with a fresh twist. Branding from Johnnie Walker appears on the rear wing and top of chassis marking the start of a partnership with the whisky brand. Telecommunications brands Claro, Telcel and Infinitum continue their partnerships for a fourth season, while NEC branding remains on the engine cover.
Motor oil brand, Quaker State, continues its relationship with the team, as does long-time partner, Kingfisher, with its logo positioned on the engine cover. The VJM10 headrests carry eye-catching Hype Energy branding, while the team's newest partner, FXTM, takes up a position on the rear of the sidepod. The team also welcomes eyewear brand, LDNR, with its logo on the front wing end plate.
Team Principal, Dr Vijay Mallya, was the first to praise the VJM10: ""I can't remember being more excited ahead of a new season. The VJM10 looks aggressive and purposeful, and is the result of a huge effort behind the scenes over the last twelve months. We have big hopes for this car, which looks stunning in its new livery.""
With a complete overhaul of technical regulations, the VJM10 represents a clean sheet of paper in terms of design. ""This year the cars are completely new and nothing can be carried over from previous years,"" explained Chief Operating Officer, Otmar Szafnauer. ""Although we have completely new aerodynamics on the VJM10, it's fair to say that our aero philosophy is very similar to 2015 and 2016.""
Technical Director, Andrew Green, explained how the team has relished the challenge presented by the new rules and expects huge scope for in-season development: ""It's definitely a big overhaul; one that requires a change in mentality. It took a bit of time to adjust at first, but we are there now and I am confident we know where to look and where the performance is coming from with this car. The development slope is incredibly steep and we are going to see significant updates to the cars at regular intervals, right from the start; it's going to be big updates and I don't think development will start to taper off any time soon.""
Vijay Mallya remained cautious on setting a target for the season, preferring to reserve judgement until the racing begins: ""Simply repeating our performance level of 2016 will be a big task in itself. I don't want to set goals or targets other than to say that we intend to maintain the momentum we have built up in recent years and carry it into the new season. There are too many unknowns to say more than this."""
Haas VF-17 Ferrari,"Haas F1 Team's 2017 challenger in the FIA Formula One World Championship, the VF-17, made its official debut via the organization's social media platforms and website. It hits the track Monday for the first day of preseason testing at Circuit de Barcelona - Catalunya.
The VF-17 follows the team's very first car, the VF-16, which carried Haas F1 Team to an eighth-place finish in the 2016 constructor standings. Twenty-nine points were scored by the VF-16 during Haas F1 Team's inaugural season, the largest points haul of any new Formula One team in this millennium.
Incorporating ""VF"" into the name of the car is a nod to the history of Haas Automation, the team's title sponsor. The first CNC machine manufactured by Haas Automation was the VF-1 in 1988. The ""V"" stands for vertical, which is an industry standard designation for a vertical mill. Gene Haas, founder of Haas Automation, added ""F1"" to the name to unofficially designate it as the company's ""Very First One"".
As chairman of Haas F1 Team, the ""F1"" moniker of that first machine takes on added significance as Haas prepares for its second Formula One season.
""Being a Formula One participant brings a level of credibility that you just won't get through traditional advertising,"" says Haas, whose entry in 2016 became the first American Formula One team since 1986. ""People are kind of 'show me' people, like show me what you can do and then I'll believe in you. That was the initial concept - to convince people of our ability to do things others can't, and I think that translates into being a machine tool builder.
""Bigger, Better, Faster, Lighter is what we strive for in the machining industry and it's what we strive for in motorsports. People see what we can do in Formula One, and people believe Haas Automation can build world-class machine tools.""
The VF-17 was built under a new set of technical regulations featuring an advanced aerodynamic package designed to create a higher level of downforce. A wider front wing, larger barge boards, a lower and wider rear wing and a diffuser that expands 50 millimeters (two inches) in height and width comprise the changes, along with wider tires from Pirelli, by 60 millimeters (2.4 inches) in the front and 80 millimeters (3.1 inches) in the rear, a 25-percent increase to bring the front tires to 305 millimeters (12 inches) and the rear tires to 405 millimeters (15.9 inches).
I think the pedal box is the same, but all the rest is very different from last year's car,"" said Guenther Steiner, team principal, Haas F1 Team. ""You always try to make a faster car, which is normally a lighter car. Now we can put on more ballast and get better weight distribution. The aero is completely new, as are the tires, so we needed to have some built-in adjustability.
""Aesthetically, the car has a more aggressive look. It's lighter and more aerodynamically efficient. Everything we learned from our first car has been applied to our new car.""
The colors from the original car were carried over to the VF-17, but the overall scheme is different. A dark gray makes up the majority of the livery, with tones of red, black, white and light gray incorporating the look of Haas Automation's complete line of vertical and horizontal machining centers, turning centers and rotary tables and indexers. Approximately 1,300 employees encompass Haas Automation, with the Oxnard, California-based company exporting its machines to more than 60 countries. The VF-17 showcases Haas Automation's commitment to technology and innovation to a passionate, global audience."
McLaren MCL32 Honda,"A stunning new colour scheme that harks back to the team's 1960s roots, a restructure in senior management, a new race driver, and a set of challenging but exciting new technical regulations all frame the genesis of McLaren-Honda's newest Formula 1 challenger, the MCL32.
The MCL32 follows in the evolutionary footsteps of its two immediate predecessors, MP4-30 and MP4-31, but it has been overhauled in every area as the design team has looked to capitalise on a series of new aerodynamic regulations introduced for 2017.
The result is an extremely elegant but aggressive-looking race car, fitted with Honda's latest-generation power unit, the RA617H, which has been thoroughly revised by the company's team of talented engineers.
Most strikingly apparent is the MCL32's new colour scheme, which blends old-school McLaren history with contemporary thinking on vehicle livery design. The MCL32 has been exclusively painted by long-term partner AkzoNobel Sikkens, in Tarocco Orange, a custom McLaren colour with a pearl sparkle, and a contrasting satin black and gloss white finish.
The new colouration is a particularly crowd-pleasing touch, intended not only to revisit McLaren's past but also to kick-start a fresh chapter in the team's history."
Mercedes-Benz W08 EQ Power+,"Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport took the first step on the road to the 2017 Formula One season with the official presentation of the new F1 W08 EQ Power+.
The new car was launched to the team's fans from the Silverstone garages via a live 360-degree broadcast on Facebook, YouTube and the Team's official website - reinforcing the ""fan first"" approach that has grown Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport's social media community into the sport's largest, at over 14 million people.
The Launch was held as part of the Team's official 100 km Filming Day, during which the F1 W08 EQ Power+ completed its first laps on Silverstone's 2.96 km International Circuit, in the hands of both Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas.
The all-new F1 W08 EQ Power+ has been designed to maximize the performance opportunities offered by radically different aerodynamic regulations for the 2017 season which will probably see the new cars become the quickest in the history of the sport - while leaving sufficient scope for an in-season development rate expected to be among the fastest ever in Formula One.
The M08 EQ Power+ is the fourth iteration of the Turbo Hybrid generation of Power Units and has been conceived to withstand significantly increased physical loads and a more severe duty cycle under the new rules, while also maximizing potential performance developments."
Red Bull Racing RB13 Tag Heuer,"On the eve of the first of a pair of official test sessions ahead of the 2017 Formula 1 World Championship, Red Bull Racing revealed their 13th Grand Prix car. Not fazed by the unlucky number, the car was labelled the RB13. With extensive new regulations introduced for 2017, the car is quite a departure from its immediate predecessor.
Among the most significant changes was the adoption of wider tyres, bringing the overall width of the car back up to two metres. To match this increase a wider front wing was permitted, while the rear wing was also enlarged and lowered. Additionally, the designers were offered more freedom to use aerodynamic devices on the sides of the cockpit, which played right into Red Bull Racing's hands.
At the launch, the most distinct feature of the new RB13 was the open nose tip, which is believed to be used to feed air through the nose towards the now more elaborate barge-boards. The rule changes have also prompted most teams, Red Bull Racing included, to add a shark fin on the engine cover to feed more air to the rear wing. It is not as distinct as it is painted the same flat blue as the rest of the car and features no livery.
Powering the car is once again the Tag Heuer badged Renault drivetrain consisting of a turbocharged internal combustion engine and a sophisticated hybrid system that recovers energy both during braking and from the turbocharger. Renault have worked hard to bridge the gap with the rivalling engine manufacturers and as a result the 2017 drivetrain is significantly different. This is also made possible by the removal of the token system that limited drivetrain development.
To drive the RB13, Red Bull Racing have employed the same, talented driver pairing of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen as used during most of the 2016 season."
Renault R.S.17,"Renault Sport Formula One Team has launched its 2017 challenger, the R.S.17, at a showcase event in front of international media and team partners, in London, England.
Highlighting new partners and sponsors including BP, Castrol and MAPFRE, the launch was also the first public revealing of the new Renault Sport brand identity, designed to provide a stronger link between Renault Sport Racing and Renault Sport Cars.
Powered by Renault Sport Racing's R.E.17 power unit, the R.S.17 has no carry over parts from the R.S.16. The team has worked from a clean sheet of paper to respond to Formula 1's latest regulations. It is the first Formula 1 car designed from the outset by Renault Sport Racing from its two locations in Enstone, England and Viry-Châtillon, France.
Present at the launch were Thierry Koskas, Groupe Renault Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Jérôme Stoll, President and Cyril Abiteboul, Managing Director of Renault Sport Racing, as well as Renault Sport Formula One Team's senior management and drivers, and Alain Prost as Renault Sport Racing Special Advisor.
The R.S.17 was unveiled by race drivers Nico Hülkenberg and Jolyon Palmer, whilst Third and Reserve Driver Sergey Sirotkin was also announced during the launch."
Sauber C36 Ferrari,"In 2017 the Sauber F1 Team celebrates another milestone: it is the 25th Formula One season in the teams' history. Together with its new owner, Longbow Finance S. A., the Sauber F1 Team starts a new era. In the 2017 FIA Formula One World Championship the Swiss team will again be competing with driver Marcus Ericsson (SE, 26) and the new arrival Pascal Wehrlein (DE, 22). The official rollout of the new Sauber C36-Ferrari will take place on the occasion of the first winter tests at the Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona from 27 February to 2 March.
Not only will Formula One be starting a fresh era with its new technical regulations and rules, but also the Sauber F1 Team. With new ownership, the Sauber Group has the chance of a new beginning, and can establish itself and can create a solid basis for a competitive and successful future. CEO and Team Principal Monisha Kaltenborn is looking forward to exciting times: ""Together with Longbow Finance S. A., we have great opportunites to be competitive again and to return to previous successes in Formula One. We want to position ourselves with a new approach, and we have already taken the first steps in order to build a solid foundation for the future.""
Despite the fact that Formula One and its teams will again enter new territory based on the new technical regulations and rules in 2017, the Sauber F1 Team's expectations are straight to the point: ""We clearly have to improve,"" says Monisha Kaltenborn. ""With the Sauber C36-Ferrarii we have a solid basis as well as the resources to further develop the Sauber C36-Ferrari through the season. This will be important to establish in mid-field.""
In Jörg Zander a new technical director arrived at the high-tech factory in Hinwil in January 2017. The first thing he had to do was to get an overview of the technical prerequisites and to familiarise himself with both the new and the old conditions, which he soon managed to do because he felt comfortable from day one. Jörg Zander is a familiar face, returning to the Swiss team after having worked there from 2006 to 2007 as chief designer for the BMW Sauber F1 Team.
The German summarises the most conspicuous changes that define the Sauber C36-Ferrari due to the new regulations: ""The cars are becoming wider again, from 1.80 to 2 metres, the tyres are 25 % wider, the front and rear wings are becoming wider as well, plus the diffuser is being enlarged. In total, this means more downforce, more grip and, as a result, faster lap times."" Consequently, work on the concept of the new car was focused on reducing the drag coefficient (due to the wider tyres) to a minimum as well as achieving a significant weight reduction, for instance by means of the new roll structure. In certain areas of lightweight design the team went to the limits. The aero concept includes the optimisation of the front and rear wings and the underfloor. The radiator, the sidepods and the bodywork were designed to be as slim as possible. Clear progress was also achieved in terms of additional downforce. The key here is to keep downforce, which is generated via driving, and remain stable in various track sections. Jörg Zander explains the changes in the development procedure in more precise terms: ""We put greater emphasis on aerodynamic stability as opposed to maximising downforce.""
""Basically, big teams also have an advantage when it comes to major changes in the regulations,"" says Jörg Zander, ""but when the cards are reshuffled new opportunities always present themselves as well. The Sauber C36-Ferrari is wider and lower, with wider tyres making the car look more muscular than last year's model, the C35. Practically just by looking at it, one can tell the speed the new car has increased as a result of more downforce and shorter braking distances "" measured against lap time, not top speed "" it is written all over its face. The width of the front tyres has increased from 245 to 305 mm, that of the rear tyres from 325 to 405 mm. Something that has not changed compared with 2016 is the fact that the wider tyres will be able to decide races as well when it comes to how they work and harmonise with the car's setup and with respect to wear. ""With the tyres one might be able to mask deficits and get development concepts to work better,"" says Jörg Zander.
The Sauber C36-Ferrari is a car which, due to the new technical regulations, has been redesigned from scratch. There is not a single part that could be adopted from its C35 predecessor. In 2017, the Ferrari powertrain in the Abu Dhabi 2016 configuration will be used initially together with the C36. One of the changes this season is that only four of the six units of a powertrain can be changed without penalty. In the next few years the number will be further reduced, which is why the manufacturers are going to put greater emphasis on the durability than on the top speed of their units. Jörg Zander regards the 2016-spec engine as ""a tried and tested system with higher durability to begin with."" In addition, with respect to the design resources in planning the development of the C36, Jörg Zander says that ""being able to get started early and defining the engine environment was an advantage because the team was familiar with the engine and the transmission as well as the cooling requirements the engine entailed."""
Toro Rosso STR12 Renault,"On the eve of the first day of pre-season testing, Scuderia Toro Rosso revealed its 2017 challenger, the STR12. Drivers Daniil Kvyat and Carlos Sainz unveiled the car, featuring a stunning new livery, in the Barcelona-Catalunya Circuit pit lane this evening.
Franz Tost (Team Principal) ""For all Formula 1 fans, 2017 should be a year of excitement and uncertainty, as the sport's technical regulations have undergone one of the biggest changes we have seen in a couple of decades. In simple terms, the cars are wider, longer, lower, faster, noisier and use bigger tyres, promising more grip, higher cornering speeds and hopefully even closer racing.
Everyone in the team has worked extremely hard to ensure we have a very competitive season. Our chassis is mated to what is possibly the most competitive engine we have had so far in the hybrid era, as we return to Renault power once more.
Daniil Kvyat will be in his fourth year as a Formula 1 driver and Carlos Sainz will now tackle his third season with us. They are a very talented pairing and they have worked very hard over the winter to be ready for the additional physical challenges involved in driving these new and faster cars. The crew that will look after the cars at the track is also very well prepared and generally, throughout the company we have the stability and strength in depth to tackle this season, when the pace of car development will be much faster than over the past couple of years. Finally, we really like the first major livery change of our twelve years on the F1 grid and this new look is reflected in our pit garage, which has also been updated to make life easier while working around these much larger cars.""
James Key (Technical Director) ""With driver continuity and a power unit which made a major step forward last year and which should be developing strongly this year, it just leaves the chassis as an unknown quantity. We always set ourselves ambitious targets and this year, we are taking a more long-term view over the 20 races, with a long list of planned in-season developments. I suspect it will be a very busy year with plenty of performance still to be found."""
Williams FW40 Mercedes,"The Williams Mercedes FW40 was revealed online ahead of pre-season testing in Barcelona. This is a precursor to the first pre-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona, where the car will be seen on track for the first time with Felipe Massa behind the wheel on Monday 27th February.
With the first race of the 2017 Formula One season just around the corner, it's shaping up to be one of the most highly-anticipated seasons in recent memory.
The new regulations could shake up the grid as everyone tries to find the best solution to the new regulations. This season, we will see the return of wider tyres, as well as revamped aerodynamics and a more physically demanding experience for the drivers.
Celebrating 40 years in the sport this year, the first image of the team's 2017 challenger, the Williams Mercedes FW40, shows a very different look to 2016's FW38.
This season we will see wider bodywork, wider front and rear wings, and fatter tyres. As a result of this, there will be a significant increase in downforce and mechanical grip with the 2017 cars really able to attack the corners, significantly faster than they have done in recent years. That, in turn, means braking distances will be reduced and G-loading will increase.
Drivers will be pushed to their limits physically, which is why a key focus for them over the winter has been on training hard in preparation, with the primary focus on upper body strength. With the increased downforce there comes an increase in drag, and in some cases a reduction in the higher top speeds we have seen in recent years. That doesn't mean laptimes will increase though, quite the opposite.
Laptimes are predicted to fall and lap records are expected to be broken. To set blistering laptimes, teams will need some heavy duty rubber to stick to the track. Pirelli have certainly delivered that with the significantly wider front and rear tyres. The front tyres are 60mm wider, but the rear tyres have increased by a staggering 80mm. This also poses a new challenge for the pit crew with heavier tyres and modified wheel guns needed. Practice is underway as the team prepares to fight to keep its position as the fastest pit crew in Formula One.
In order to be quick out of the blocks, teams will need to understand the new tyres, and do so quickly if they want to be, and remain, competitive. The team has increased its effort in this area which will hopefully mean it can start the season already having a good understanding of the new rubber. In-season tyre testing will also be more crucial than ever before, as understanding the tyres and how they work will be one of the key factors in pulling performance from the car.
Although cosmetically the 2017 cars will look very different to their 2016 predecessors, the core of the car, the power unit and the areas situated around the power unit, have not changed a great deal.
Barcelona's pre-season testing will give teams the first real indication of how the cars are going to perform. But, similar to the engine regulation change in 2014, no one will have a real sense of the pecking order until we get to Melbourne. Even then, things can change extremely quickly, especially when the margins between success and failure are as slight as they are in Formula One."
Ferrari SF16-H,"A shortened nose, a tapered rear end and an intriguing red-and-white livery are the signature features of the new SF16-H. The name refers to the hybrid powertrain, which enters its third season in the Formula One World Championship."
Force India VJM09 Mercedes,"Sahara Force India marked the beginning of its season today as Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez pulled the covers off the VJM09 in Barcelona. They were joined by the team's development driver, Alfonso Celis, as they posed for photos in front of the world's media ahead of the start of the team's winter testing programme.
The stability in the technical regulations means the VJM09 is more evolution than revolution, building on the strengths of the 2015 b-spec chassis that helped the team secure fifth place in the championship last year.
""You can say the b-spec car from last year formed a basis on which to build our 2016 one,"" explains Technical Director, Andrew Green. ""We were in a situation in which the performance on track was very good, and in which the data we were getting correlated well to what we were expecting, so we knew we could continue to develop on a solid platform. With the regulations likely to change for 2017, it didn't really seem like an efficient use of our resources to start from scratch on a project that would have such a limited lifetime.""
The VJM09 retains the distinctive black and silver livery introduced last year as Team Principal, Vijay Mallya explains: ""The colours reflect our partners and heritage. Although I'm biased, I think our car is one of the best looking on the grid and that's why I wanted to keep a consistent look for 2016. As they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""
Expectations for the VJM09 are high as the team looks to build on its best ever performance last year. ""I want us to begin 2016 in the same way that we ended 2015,"" confirms Vijay Mallya. ""Our technical team is excited about the progress we have made over the winter and there's every reason to believe we can stay at the front of the midfield battle.""
Chief Operating Officer, Otmar Szafnauer adds: ""The wind tunnel programme in Cologne is maturing nicely and I'm encouraged by the gains we have made over the winter. The first major aero updates should be on the car in time for Melbourne and we also plan another big step for the start of the European season.""
The VJM09 continues to carry a number of blue-chip names with prominent branding from TelCel, Claro and NEC, underlining the commercial appeal of the team. Logos from financial services firm, Banamex, have been added to the leading edge of the side pod, while partnerships with Inter, Quaker State and Hype have also been extended. The team's long-standing association with Kingfisher and Royal Challenge continue."
Haas VF-16 Ferrari,"The VF-16, Haas F1 Team's first racecar, has arrived. The car officially broke cover via Haas F1 Team's social media channels and Website. It hits the track Monday for the first day of preseason testing at the Circuit de Barcelona - Catalunya.
The origin of naming the car ""VF-16"" goes back to the first CNC machine manufactured by Haas Automation, the VF-1, launched in 1988. The ""V"" stands for vertical, which is an industry standard designation for a vertical mill. Gene Haas, founder of Haas Automation, added ""F1"" to the name to unofficially designate it as the company's ""Very First One"".
Now as chairman of Haas F1 Team, the ""F1"" moniker of that first machine takes on new significance as Haas joins the 2016 FIA Formula One World Championship, becoming the first American-led Formula One team in 30 years.
""From an international standpoint, Formula One is the highest echelon of racing, and Haas Automation builds the highest-quality machine tools,"" said Haas, who has grown Haas Automation into the largest machine tool builder in North America with more than $1 billion in annual sales. ""When you hear 'F1' you know exactly what it is - a global racing series that showcases the latest technology and attracts the best talent in engineering and design. Haas Automation has an excellent reputation in the United States and I want that reputation to grow worldwide. Connecting Haas Automation with F1 in name and in practice is the best way to grow our business and elevate Haas Automation to a premium, global brand.""
The dark gray, light gray and red-toned livery of the VF-16 was derived from the scheme of Haas Automation's complete line of vertical and horizontal machining centers, turning centers and rotary tables and indexers. Approximately 1,300 employees encompass Haas Automation, with the Oxnard, California-based company exporting those machines to more than 60 countries. The VF-16 showcases Haas Automation's commitment to technology and innovation to a passionate, global audience.
""Just as Haas Automation's products continually evolve, becoming better and more efficient, our methodology behind the VF-16 was to make it the best evolution of a good F1 car,"" said Guenther Steiner, team principal, Haas F1 Team. ""We're a new team, so we looked at what the successful teams were doing to give us a baseline of the direction we needed to go with our design.
""We have very experienced designers who worked hard to develop all the little things from an aerodynamic perspective that, collectively, add up to a lot. And our technical partner, Ferrari, provided our power unit, and that really defined the rear end of the car and how big it needed to be.
""Our goal with this car is to score points,"" Steiner states. ""First, we need to go out there and show that we can do the job, that we can finish races, that we are respected by the fans and other teams in the paddock. Then, we want to score points. That is the ultimate goal.""
The VF-16 tests at Barcelona Feb. 22-25 and again March 1-4 before its debut race, the season-opening Australian Grand Prix March 20 in Melbourne."
McLaren MP4-31 Honda,"McLaren-Honda today reveals its brand-new Formula 1 challenger, the MP4-31, ahead of the first all-team test, which will begin in Barcelona.
The striking and innovative MP4-31 chassis integrates the new Honda RA616H power unit, developed exclusively for the team.
Although a high level of continuity in Formula 1's technical regulations has enabled the team to strengthen and mature many of the design concepts developed on last year's McLaren-Honda MP4-30, the new car also incorporates a significant number of all-new innovations. The result is a balance of remarkably elegant aerodynamic solutions with a highly space-efficient integration of Honda's new-for-2016 power unit.
While McLaren's race team has spent an extremely busy few months developing the MP4-31 right up to the very tight deadline dictated by the truncated modern off-season, its marketing team has also enjoyed a very strong winter, announcing a raft of prestigious new commercial deals to add to a roster of equally valued existing partners.
Joining McLaren-Honda's partner group for 2016 will be the world-renowned luxury watch brand Richard Mille, which commences a 10-year marketing, branding and licensing collaboration.
Global luxury goods giant LVMH will continue its long unbroken association with the team, through its premium sparkling wine brand Chandon, whose rising-star identity will adorn both the MP4-31 and the drivers' race suits.
Other important and valuable recent acquisitions include a brand-new haulage supplier, Volvo Trucks, and a brand-new technical services provider, IT Lab, while official services supplier ISS has renewed and extended its partnership. Also, official electronic communications supplier Kenwood celebrates 25 years as a McLaren partner this year. Finally, 2016 marks the second year of a 10-year alliance with KPMG.
In addition to the aforementioned acquisitions and renewals, McLaren-Honda is once again privileged to count on the loyal support of an impressive portfolio of partners old and new, including Johnnie Walker, SAP, Hilton Worldwide, CNN, Santander, GSK, Mazak, AkzoNobel Sikkens, Segafredo Zanetti, Akebono, Norton Rose Fulbright, Enkei, Repucom, Sparco, Maxi Nutrition, Asics and TechnoGym.
Last but very far from least, McLaren-Honda's preparations for 2016 have once again benefitted enormously from the unrivalled resources and expertise of ExxonMobil, which is celebrating 22 years of partnership with McLaren this year. ExxonMobil's engineers, together with their counterparts at Honda, have been tirelessly developing pioneering new technologies and formulations of Esso fuels and Mobil 1 lubricants for the all-new Honda RA616H V6 turbo power unit, and Mobilube 1 SHC racing gear oil for McLaren's bespoke eight-speed gearbox.
Importantly, the size and calibre of our partner roster - and its collective commitment to the team - underscores the confidence that all at McLaren have in our journey back to the podium."
Mercedes-Benz W07 Hybrid,"Following the dominant performance during the 2015 season, the Mercedes-Benz F1 team worked over the winter to further refine the existing design to create the W07 Hybrid. The stability in the regulations also allowed the team to carry over many of the major design elements. What did require changes were the raised cockpit sides for additional driver safety and the separate waste-gate exhaust intended to improve the sound of the turbo-hybrid drivetrain."
Red Bull Racing RB12 Tag-Heuer,"Beyond the striking matte livery unveiled in London last week, the all-new RB12 incorporates a host of improvements based on the lessons learned from the 2015 season.
Commenting on the new car and the season ahead, Team Principal, Christian Horner said: ""Obviously the late engine decision last year was a challenge but we found a solution in time and the whole team has worked incredibly hard to recover over the winter. Therefore, we're looking to build on the significant progress we made in the second half of 2015 and to carry that momentum into the early races of this season.
""My hopes for this season are that we genuinely make progress from where we were last year; that we get our heads down and we really develop the car well and hopefully with some performance coming on the power unit side as well that will allow us to get closer to some of our immediate rivals.""
Speaking about the design of the RB12, Chief Technical Officer, Adrian Newey added: ""I'm often asked what area of the car I'm most pleased with but with the stable regulations we have at the moment it's difficult to find any major new areas to exploit. Therefore, what we've really tried to concentrate on with this car is getting a cohesive package for all the parts - the suspension, the chassis dynamics, aerodynamics - that they all work together in harmony. I think we've managed to build on the lessons of last year and all the indications from our simulations suggest that this year's chassis should be strong.""
Chief Engineering Officer, Rob Marshall added: ""With the RB12, we are optimistic that we have made some good gains, but the difficulty is the wind tunnel and CFD numbers we're seeing are our numbers and unless you can see everyone else's numbers you don't know where you are. We are happy that we are going in the right direction from our own point of view, but we won't know until Melbourne. As far as this car is concerned, I hope we can win some races. That might sound farfetched after last year, where we struggled at the beginning of the year, but I hope this year we can make a bit of a step power-wise and that will level the playing field a bit.""
Commenting further on simulation work with the RB12, Dan Fallows, Head of Aerodynamics, said: ""So far, the numbers coming out of the wind tunnel and CFD are encouraging. It's a function of everyone understanding the car that we had last year but also identifying the challenges we had and really focusing on those and I think we have made some fairly big steps forward.
""My hopes for the RB12 are that it continues the form that we had with the RB11. Obviously we didn't get the results we hoped for but we all knew we had a good foundation in the car, in the chassis, and I'd like to see that continue. Also, the thing I'd really like to see is that the car give us a good foundation for any upgrades we get on the power unit side, from aero and everything else.""
Pierre Waché, Chief Engineer, Performance Engineering added: ""To be satisfied with the numbers from aero is a big word, we are never satisfied. It is a continuous development process and we are not looking for absolute numbers, we are looking for relative numbers compared to others. The progress is significant and we will see if it's enough.""
Looking ahead to the new season, Paul Monaghan, Chief Engineer, Car Engineering concluded: ""My hopes for the RB12? I think we have to focus on just making sure we go to Australia in the best state we can be, well prepared and then get the most out of the car we can at each race and put ourselves in a position where we can challenge for a podium or benefit from anything that happens around us."""
Renault R.S. 16,"At the core of the racing activities will be the newly-created Renault Sport Formula One Team. The new F1 challenger consists of the Renault R.S.16 chassis, developed and manufactured in Enstone, whilst the Renault R.E.16 power unit will continue to be developed in Viry-Châtillon.
A number of key appointments have been made in the F1 team to avoid any dilution of the specific requirements of Formula One. Bob Bell is appointed F1 Chief Technical Officer and will manage the efforts of Nick Chester as Chassis Technical Director and Rémi Taffin as Engine Technical Director. Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer are confirmed as Renault Sport Formula One Team's race drivers, and will be supported by Esteban Ocon, who joins the team as Third and Reserve Driver."
Sauber C35 Ferrari,"Mark Smith, Technical Director of the Sauber F1 Team, joined the Swiss team in July 2015 with the mission of coming up with a different approach. With only a few changes in the regulations for the 2016 season, the Sauber C35-Ferrari is based on three key facts: a slightly different aerodynamic philosophy, adapting to changes within the power unit architecture as well as weight reduction.
""For the development of the Sauber C35-Ferrari, we slightly changed the philosophy of how we developed the car aerodynamically. It sounds little, but the impact on the development of the car is significant,"" says Mark Smith. ""When looking at the Sauber C35, it is very much an evolution,"" he adds.
Chassis: The packaging of the 2016 power unit changed. This had an impact on the design of the monocoque of the Sauber C35. Moreover, this year's gearbox from Ferrari also allowed the designers/engineers to take advantage of a tighter packaging, a more aerodynamic packaging in terms of bodywork. The side pods are smaller and packed tighter than they were on the Sauber C34. This also affected the cooling system, which has been pushed tight.
Weight: There are few areas in the car where weight has been increased. It was a challenge for the designers to take weight out of other areas, so that was a focus right away through the design procedure, and quite a demanding one as well.
More Sound: In terms of regulations the exhaust system is slightly different. In the 2016 season teams must have either one or two wastegate tailpipes. For 2016 we have a single rear wing pylon which passes through the tailpipe.
Cockpit: Due to the regulations the cockpit rim has been increased in height for driver protection. There will also be a small high-speed on-board camera to capture the movements of the driver's head for accident analysis.
Tyres: Besides the supersoft, soft, medium and hard tyres, Pirelli will introduce the new ultrasoft tyre for the 2016 season.
Engine: For engine suppliers the number of tokens has increased from 25 last year to 32 in 2016, which gives them more freedom in changing the structure of the power unit. The Sauber C35 engine, energy recovery system and gearbox are again supplied by Ferrari."
Toro Rosso STR11 Ferrari,"Following a last minute switch to Ferrari engines, Scuderia Toro Rosso had to work overtime to get their new STR11 ready for the season opening test at Barcelona. They pulled it off and the comprehensively revised machine was one of the first to hit the track at what was 2016's first outing."
Williams FW38 Mercedes,"The new Williams Mercedes FW38 was unveiled today ahead of the first pre-season test in Barcelona, Spain next week.
For a third successive season the iconic red, white and blue stripes of WILLIAMS MARTINI RACING will be lining up on the Formula One grid, with the team looking to build on a successful 2015 season that resulted in four podiums and a third place finish in the Constructors' Championship.
Commenting on the new FW38 Sir Frank Williams, Founder and Team Principal, said; ""Williams has started to cement our position back amongst the front running teams after finishing third in the Championship in the past two seasons. This has been a great achievement given the resources of those around us. Staying where we are will be a challenge in itself, but we are determined to keep improving because only winning will ever be good enough.
""We have a very stable team going into 2016, with Felipe and Valtteri teaming up for a third successive season. They work well together and both have the ideal blend of speed and consistency. Our technical team has also remained very consistent which will be to our advantage and we have some of the best engineering minds on the grid at our disposal.
""We have a busy couple of weeks of testing coming up to learn more about our package and to refine the car ahead of the first race. We will have to wait until Melbourne to find out exactly where we stand in the pecking order but I'm confident that our hard work over the winter will stand us in good stead.""
Felipe Massa added; ""Securing third in the Constructors' Championship for two consecutive years is a great achievement and one that comes with a lot of expectation - a momentum which I am excited to build on going into the new season. The team at the factory have worked really hard on the new car and we have spent a lot of time understanding where we need to improve. I have a lot of confidence in the team at Williams and I'm looking forward to getting behind the wheel of the FW38 to see how it performs. I'm equally delighted to be teammates with Valtteri for another year. He is a very talented driver who brings a lot to the team.""
Valtteri Bottas, who is about to embark on his fourth season in Formula One with Williams, said: ""This is always a really interesting and exciting time of the year because we have a new car and we can't wait to get it out on track to see how it feels and how fast it is. It's been a good winter and from what I've seen we seem to be headed in a good direction with this car. Testing next week will be our chance to see how our performance has improved since the last race. The development of the FW38 has been all positive in theory, now we just need to see it on track.
""As a team we need to be able to win races, which is what we are always trying to do. I'm sure we have made improvements everywhere as a team, so we're definitely looking to fight for better results this year. I'd like to thank everyone at the factory for their hard work over the winter in getting the car ready.""
Claire Williams, Deputy Team Principal, concluded. ""2016 promises to be a very competitive year in Formula One and there will be a number of strong teams who have us in their sights. We are confident that we have made a step forward over the winter and that the FW38 will build on the strengths of the FW37 and address some of its weaknesses. We started design work on the car earlier than normal and hopefully this extra development time will stand us in good stead.
""The car we are launching today is by no means the final product. We are already planning updates for Melbourne and will be pushing for constant improvements over the course of the season. Williams enters 2016 in a strong place. We have a great team of people and over the past two years we have started to regain our competitive edge. Now we need to build on that and take this team back to where we all want it to be.""
The FW38 will take to the track for the first time on 22nd February for eight days of testing that concludes on 4th March. The season officially gets under way at the first race in Melbourne, Australia, on 20th March."
Ferrari SF15-T,"The SF15-T the sixty first car built by Ferrari specifically to take part in the Formula 1 World Championship. It is the second car made by Ferrari since the reintroduction of turbo engines in 2014. The first year of these new regulations was extremely challenging for the Scuderia and the lessons learned have been applied vigorously to the SF15-T to create a car that is in every respect a large step forwards with respect to the F14-T.
The most striking visual difference between the SF15-T and its predecessor is the lowering of the front end of the car in accordance with the change of regulations for the 2015 season. After a few seasons of rather unappealing aesthetics, the 2015 rules permit the SF15-T an attractive nose shape which also brings excellent aerodynamic performance. Aside from the nose area, the regulations for 2015 are largely unchanged. This has given the Team a stable base on which to engineer a much stronger chassis than the year before:
A casual glance at the back of the car reveals a much more tightly packaged rear end which allows more downforce to be extracted from the critical surfaces around the rear of the car. The rear wing family has been extensively redesigned to deliver stable performance in corners while producing a larger DRS effect on the straights. The front and rear brake ducts have been remodeled to produce more cooling of caliper and brake disk while generating more downforce than their 2014 counterparts. Both front and rear suspension kinematics have been overhauled to present the tyre to the road in a manner that allows better use of the Pirelli rubber.
As in 2014, the current rules place heavy emphasis on the strong integration of Power Unit and Chassis. Integration is not just about packaging - finding neat homes for all the myriad equipment in the car - it is more about making sure that the PU and Chassis are specified so that the resulting vehicle will have the highest possible performance. A range of carefully chosen design targets ensure that the SF15-T has optimum choice of cooling to provide the best overall downforce and power levels. In addition to carefully designed internal airflow, the SF15-T has a much improved cooler matrix layout that allows several tenths of a second per lap compared to the previous year.
2014 was the first year of the so called Brake -by-Wire (BBW); a system permitted by the rules as a way of allowing the maximum amount of electric power to be harvested under braking while maintaining an optimal brake balance. In practice, it proved much easier to obtain the former than the latter with the first versions of this system. The BBW was improved greatly during the 2014 season and the SF15-T is further optimized to produce a braking response that should allow the driver sensitive control while braking at the limit.
The broadly stable regulations for 2015 have allowed Ferrari to work on the details of our transmission, carrying forward lessons learned in 2014 to make sure that the SF15-T is a step forward in all areas. The choice of 8 forward gear ratios are fixed for the entire season once they are run in the first race, and our experience from last year has allowed us to choose these ratios carefully for best use over the course of the season. The clutch, traditionally a strong point for the Scuderia, has been further improved with a series of detailed changes to make sure that the SF15-T will continue to enjoy strong performance off the start line.
The regulations allow the weight of the car to increase by 11kg with respect to the 2014 car. The SF15-T uses this extra allowance in the regulations to buy some additional performance features under the skin of the car while retaining a workable level of ballast to trim the centre of gravity of the car.
The 2015 tyres are little changed from 2014. A new rear casing tested by all the Teams towards the end of last year delivers better rear end grip, especially while loaded in combined conditions of cornering and traction. The range of compounds for the season and the selection of compounds taken to each circuit will be very similar to 2014. However, the performance level of the SF15-T will be much higher than the F14T, and should allow Ferrari to exploit all the performance available in the rubber."
Force India VJM08 Mercedes,"Sahara Force India launched its 2015 season, offering fans and media a first impression of how the VJM08 will look when it makes its track debut next month. A spectacular event at the Soumaya museum in Mexico City saw Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg pull back the covers to reveal the team's fresh new look for 2015.
The new car livery is guaranteed to get heads turning. The chassis features an elegant combination of silver and black with the team's traditional colour of orange streaking from the nose cone to the rear of the car in two symmetrical curves.
Key to the new livery is the introduction of several commercial partners for 2015. Prominent NEC branding appears on the engine cover to signal the beginning of a relationship with the global ICT firm based in Tokyo, Japan. Also on the engine cover are the logos of telecommunications brands Claro and Telcel as America Movil begins its second season supporting the team.
Branding from world-famous tequila brand, Jose Cuervo, features on the car's headrest, while logos from Latin America's leading insurance broker, Inter, appear on the front wing end plates. Motor oil brand, Quaker State, also partners with the team placing its logos on the rear wing end plates.
The team is also delighted to extend its partnership with Smirnoff for a second season, in addition to the continuation of long-time partners United Spirits, Kingfisher and Royal Challenge.
Team Principal, Dr Vijay Mallya, was the first to praise the team's new livery: ""It's another evolution of the contemporary look we introduced last year, which reflects the growth of the team and the global brands with which we are working. I love the addition of silver, which makes the car appear more sleek and aggressive and I'm sure it's something that will appeal to the fans as well. Our traditional team colours remain integrated in the livery, but we've given it a very modern twist.""
With relatively stable technical regulations, the VJM08 has been designed with evolution rather than revolution in mind. The most significant changes from the outside will appear at the front of the car with the lowering of the front of the chassis and nose. ""The front of the car looks very different from what we had developed previously,"" explains Technical Director Andrew Green. ""It is a redesign that involved a lot of work over the winter, as the new regulations caused a loss in terms of downforce and we've been working to claw back all that performance.""
The VJM08 will also feature several subtle changes, including modified sculpting of the sidepods and new cooling intakes. Underneath the skin there will be a completely new rear suspension layout with a new hydro-mechanical system replacing the original torsion springs. The VJM08 is expected to make its track testing debut in Barcelona next month with the VJM07 running at the first test in Jerez."
Lotus E23 Hybrid Mercedes,"Following two successful seasons, the Enstone-based Lotus team had a disastrous 2014. As a result of the success in 2012 and 2013, some key personnel including lead engineers and star-driver Kimi Raikkonen had left the team. What also did not help was that the new-for-2014 Renault power unit was not up to par. In addition to the disappointing results, continuous concerns over the team's financial situation also dampened the mood.
In a quest to bounce back in 2015, the team switched engine suppliers during the winter from Renault to Mercedes-AMG, who unquestionably were a step, or two ahead of the rest in 2014. The hybrid drivetrain was bolted to the new Lotus E23 chassis, which featured a conventional layout with push-rod front and pull-rod rear suspension. As in 2014, an eight-speed, paddle operated gearbox was fitted. Also carried over from the previous year were drivers Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado.
It seemed the team was not quite ready for the new season again as it arrived late on the first of three official four-day test sessions. These woes were quickly forgotten and during the second test at Barcelona, the Lotus E23 Hybrid Mercedes topped the time sheets three of the four days. Whether this pre-season performance will be translated in actual results will of course be a whole different matter."
McLaren MP4-30 Honda,"McLaren-Honda - the name evokes stirring memories of the past; of Ayrton Senna battling Alain Prost for supremacy; of classic red and white machines dominating for season upon season; of an iconic team writing one of the defining chapters in the motor racing history books.
Reuniting such an illustrious partnership brings with it the heavy weight of expectation, but all at McLaren and Honda are working to write a fresh chapter in Formula 1, one that respectfully nods to the past, but boldly looks to the horizon.
Today's reveal of the new McLaren-Honda MP4-30 - McLaren's first Honda-powered car for 23 years - speaks volumes about the progressive nature of both companies. It is a thoroughly refined evolution of last year's McLaren, it is the only chassis on the grid to be fitted with Honda's RA615H Hybrid power unit, and it features an evolved colour scheme that firmly contextualises McLaren's brand in the 21st century.
In 2015 McLaren-Honda intends to maintain the momentum it achieved during the second half of 2014, when an intensive technical development programme for the MP4-29 allowed the team to establish a solid position within the chasing pack.
Relatively stable technical regulations between seasons have permitted our engineers to evolve some of the newer philosophies explored on last year's season-ending car while also adding some exciting new technical DNA into the mix.
Moreover, our restructured and strengthened engineering departments have gained the conviction to embark on a number of changes of direction. With that in mind, the MP4-30 has been developed to provide us with the most effective and practical base package. It is a foundation - offering up a number of new exploratory development paths for our engineers, aerodynamicists and drivers to pursue during the season, and on into next year.
The car has been aerodynamically developed over the winter, and the result is a pretty, elegant design with a refined nose-box solution, slimmed rear-end packaging - particularly around the gearbox - and the incorporation of an all-new power unit under its tightly contoured bodywork.
The partnership with Honda is particularly exciting: to achieve success within the technical regulations requires a bespoke engineering solution that can be achieved only in collaboration with a works partner. Honda will provide the know-how, the expertise and the muscle to make rapid progress - and to keep pushing development, on all fronts, during the season. The partnership will be a work in progress, but it will only strengthen over time.
Achieving our ambitious targets will not happen immediately - winning in Formula 1 is a lengthy, iterative process, and one that will gather collective momentum from season to season - but, with the MP4-30 as a base, McLaren and Honda feel they are ready to make quick and efficient progress towards a successful future.
The team's preparations for 2015 have drawn upon the considerable resources of ExxonMobil, who have been working with our new colleagues at Honda for two years on developing new technologies and formulations of Mobil 1 engine lubricants for the Honda V6 turbo. In turn, the team's technology partner, SAP, provides its secure HANA Enterprise Cloud solution which underpins the entire McLaren Group, strengthening and simplifying the way the team runs its data management and modelling.
There are significant milestones to commemorate in 2015: this year marks McLaren's 30th consecutive year of partnership with TAG Heuer, while both Johnnie Walker and Hilton Worldwide are celebrating 10 years with the team. Such long-standing relationships underline McLaren's ability to support and enhance any blue-chip brand's global marketing programme.
Joining us for 2015 are international news broadcaster CNN and professional services company KPMG, which have both formed important strategic alliances with the McLaren Technology Group. McLaren-Honda is also pleased to welcome back the global coffee brand Segafredo Zanetti, which first partnered the team during the original McLaren-Honda era."
Mercedes-Benz W06 Hybrid,"The MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team today unveiled its 2015 Formula One World Championship challenger, the F1 W06 Hybrid, ahead of the first day of pre-season testing at the Circuito de Jerez in Spain. Drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg revealed the seventh Silver Arrow to compete in the Formula One World Championship to the assembled media, with Nico then taking the wheel for the opening test session of the 2015 season at the Spanish circuit.
2015 marks the beginning of an evolutionary process for the cutting-edge Hybrid racing formula introduced for 2014. But the word evolution shouldn't mask the scale of the change this represents: the regulatory requirements and opportunities, coupled with ambitious internal performance targets, mean that this winter has been as challenging as ever. The more stable the rules, the more innovative a team must become to deliver performance from each generation of racing machine.
""From outside, winter might look like a rest time in Formula One. But this couldn't be further from the truth"", explains Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport. ""Long before the end of last season, development work on our 2015 car became the main priority. The winter months are the most intense, with everybody at Brackley and Brixworth working around the clock to prepare for the season ahead. Their dedication is inspiring. It would be so dangerous to rest on our laurels after 2014 - but none of us have any sense that things will be easier now. On the contrary, our motivation is as high as ever. There's a famous Babe Ruth quote I always say to people: ""Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games"". We are fully aware that success is not only hard won but can also be short-lived without the right approach.
""A lot of things have been put in place - not by one individual but by many individuals working as a team. And this has been about taking the right decisions at the right time, trying to avoid mistakes and, if they do happen, quickly analysing why. Even if, on paper, things are looking good, we will not fall into the trap of being overly optimistic or trying to make crystal ball predictions because this is not how the sport works. In fact, this is possibly the most brutally honest sport because the stopwatch never lies.
""The launch of a new car is an exciting moment for everybody involved. To see the product of all that hard work turn a wheel for the first time is a great source of pride - and rightly so. However, there is a long road ahead before we reach the first race. We must build a fast, reliable racing car to be able to compete with rivals whose ability and competitiveness can never be underestimated. At this point, every team is on zero points. The only thing we know for sure is that we have consistency in our driver line-up for the third year running and they know what's expected of them, just as we know what they expect from us. We're looking forward to seeing them push each other and the team forward. It will be another fascinating battle between the two but we must wait until Melbourne until we know if we have provided them with a car that allows them to fight each other for wins.""
As the age of Hybrid power evolves, so the requirements for improved safety, reliability, efficiency and performance increase. An intensive design phase combining incremental gains and targeted innovation has produced the F1 W06 Hybrid, a car which delivers mechanical, structural, aerodynamic and weight saving developments over its predecessor, the F1 W05 Hybrid.
""The key factor from our perspective is avoiding complacency"", says Executive Director (Technical), Paddy Lowe. ""Expectations are now high and a lot of assumptions are being made about our potential this season. Internally, however, we are fully aware that you can never afford to stand still in any sport - particularly Formula One. We are up against competitors with a great history of success and, like us, they will not be content unless they are winning. As the old motor racing adage goes, you are only as good as your last race. This time last year, with the new Hybrid technology yet to hit the track, we went to Silverstone for a filming day and were genuinely surprised to see the car drive out of the garage! Second time around we may be over the initial hurdles of the new formula but we keep them fresh in our minds, as it demonstrates that nothing can be taken for granted. The only thing that is in our control is the ability to do the very best we can in every area.
""Of course, like every other team on the grid, we have been pushing harder than ever to find areas for performance gains. But at the same time, we must ensure we are moving in the correct direction. One of the risks with car development is that attempting forward steps can easily turn into rearward steps. You have to take risks to progress - but those risks must be carefully managed in order to produce a car that is better than its predecessor. This has been an underlying theme for the team over the winter.
""It is an evolutionary process and this also includes the regulations themselves. Relative to last winter, these have remained reasonably stable into 2015. But this is certainly not to say that the cars we see take to the track in Jerez will be near-replicas of their predecessors. Some changes will be more visually obvious, of course, but the devil is in the detail. Beneath the covers there have been a raft of developments from both a chassis and Power Unit perspective - all aimed at creating a car that is safer, more efficient, more reliable and ultimately faster. With the Hybrid era still very much in its infancy, there is plenty of scope for innovation. The challenge at this stage is to find the key areas for performance gain based not just on what we have learned a year further down the line, but also on where there is room for exploring new and innovative sources of competitive advantage."""
Red Bull Racing RB11 Renault,"After an intensely busy off-season, Infiniti Red Bull's Racing's 2015 Formula One car, the RB11, has hit the track and begun testing at the Circuito de Jerez in Spain ahead of the new season.
Featuring a striking new test livery, the RB11 features a host of improvements in all areas as the team seeks to improve on its 2014 campaign, when it took the RB10 from a difficult start to second place in the Constructors' Championship. The most notable shape change to this year's car is the lower nose box and front of the chassis, which were amended in line with the latest regulations, but beyond that many of the RB11's updates are under its all-new black and white skin.
Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey said: ""The design of the RB11 has been very much about understanding what we learned from last season, which was a big regulation change as far as the power unit is concerned and the packaging that goes with that and setting about optimising the car from those lessons.""
Chief Engineering Officer Rob Marshall added: ""There are some changes that affect the shape of the front of the car but beyond that most of the changes are under the skin. We've identified the areas where we can make improvements and we've worked hard on these. There won't be a lot that's visible to the naked eye but a lot of hard work has gone into the bits that are hidden.""
A large part of that work has involved improvements to Renault Sport's Energy F1 power unit, updates that have been made in closer collaboration with the team.
""The relationship with Renault is a lot closer now,"" says Team Principal Christian Horner of the team's technical ties with the French manufacturer. ""Red Bull is the only partner for Renault now, through ourselves and Toro Rosso, and that focus from Renault together with a close involvement with our design team is yielding good results and a far closer integration between the power unit and the chassis side. Working in unison with Renault we can really make some big steps forward this year.""
Newey adds that the process of reducing the deficit the team suffered last year will take time. ""We have been working very hard with our partners Renault to help them develop the engine,"" he says. ""What we have to remember is that the internal combustion engine and its very complicated associated items, the ERS and turbocharger, are long lead time items. Those are things where if one team takes an advantage then it takes time to overthrow that or get back on a par with or hopefully ahead."""
Sauber C34 Ferrari,"After a season with the most comprehensive technical changes in the history of Formula One, there are significantly fewer regulation changes for the 2015 season. During the development of the new Sauber C34-Ferrari the Sauber F1 Team's engineers focused on three areas: performance in slow corners, weight reduction, as well as braking stability.
Eric Gandelin, chief designer of the Sauber F1 Team, explained: ""We were able to gain a lot of experience during the course of the 2014 season, which will have an influence on the Sauber C34.""
Aerodynamics traditionally play a key role in the development of a new car. But on this occasion it wasn't only a question of optimising downforce and drag, but also improving the balance of the car and its responses in particular through low-speed corners.
The greatest visual difference compared to the Sauber C33 can be found around the nose section, which is now bigger in volume and lower to the ground following further changes to the technical regulations. This has a considerable impact on the aerodynamics of the entire car: the nose and front wing play a key role in determining how the air flows around the front wheels and how effectively the central and rear sections of the car function aerodynamically. The new design of the wheel rims has progressed in a similar direction, in the interests of optimising airflow around the front wheels.
The front suspension concept has changed little, with the springs and dampers again pushrod-actuated. However, the engineers put a lot of effort into improving the feedback from the steering for the drivers.
The sidepods of the new Sauber C34, however, are now slimmer than those of the Sauber C33, despite higher cooling requirements from the new power unit. This has been made possible by modifications to the attachment of the side crash elements. In addition, the architecture of the radiators, which are now positioned horizontally, has been fundamentally revised. The engineers also paid great attention to the flexibility of the cooling system, which can be adapted precisely - and individually for the various components - to the ambient temperature and circuit characteristics. For example, small air vents on the side of the cockpit are only used in certain situations.
Beyond this, the rear section as a whole is less voluminous, which benefits aerodynamic efficiency.
The car's minimum weight has been increased in line with the FIA's technical regulations, up from 691 kg a year ago to 702 kg now. The engineers, of course, set out to undercut this figure in order to give themselves ample room for manoeuvre when it comes to weight distribution - an important factor in determining how the car uses its tyres."
Toro Rosso STR10 Renault,"The STR10 was revealed at the Jerez de la Frontera circuit in southern Spain. As the car's codename implies, 2015 will be Scuderia Toro Rosso's tenth year in Formula 1 and CEPSA, who hosted today's launch, has sponsored the team for the past 4 years.
The drivers Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz whipped the sheets off Scuderia Toro Rosso's challenger for the 2015 Formula 1 World Championship in the Jerez pit lane, the day before the serious business of testing gets underway with four days of track action. The STR10 has been produced under the technical directorship of James Key, Chief Designers Paolo Marabini (Chief Designer - Composites & Structures) and Matteo Piraccini (Chief Designer - Mechanical & Systems.) Built by the team in Faenza, Italy, it owes its shape to the efforts of the Wind Tunnel staff in Bicester, UK. Carlos Sainz, will have the honour of being the first to drive the new car this native Spain. The other rookie Max Verstappen will drive on Monday and Wednesday, with Sainz back in on the Tuesday.
Franz Tost, Team Principal: ""The launch of the new STR10 car today here in Jerez de la Frontera marks the start of a new and hopefully thrilling F1 season. We are delighted that CEPSA has hosted us again and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them, as well as our other long-term partners, Red Bull, Nova Chemicals and Sapinda, for their continuous collaboration over the years and I'm especially pleased that they are with us again this season as Scuderia Toro Rosso marks a decade in Formula 1. I'm also happy to welcome our new sponsor Estrella Galicia 0,0, who has just joined us today.""
""The 2015 season is a new challenge for all of us. We've put a lot of work into the STR10 and we are convinced that we will have a successful year. Our objective is to finish fifth in the constructors championship and we are ready to do our best to achieve it. Our engine partner Renault has also worked very hard to come up with new modifications and I'm sure that our joint effort will give us a package which will certainly be very competitive. All in all, we have a much stronger team as well as a very competitive STR10 and fast drivers; it's a great combination.
""Another point that also makes me happy is that we have a very high-skilled young driver pairing which makes this season even more exciting. They both showed fantastic performances throughout their career, winning races and championships, and it's because of their driving skills that Red Bull has decided to bring them to Scuderia Toro Rosso. I'm really sure that they are very well prepared for this challenge, as is the rest of the team. We are ready for it!"""
Williams FW37 Mercedes,"WILLIAMS MARTINI RACING has revealed the first images of its 2015 car, the Williams Mercedes FW37. Following on from a successful season in 2014 Williams hopes the FW37 can continue the positive momentum into another competitive season of racing.
'The notion for the FW37 was to look closely at the FW36 and its performances,' says WILLIAMS MARTINI RACING Chief Technical Officer Pat Symonds. 'We then went about recognising what had worked well and identifying and resolving the areas that we felt needed to be improved. Although the aerodynamics of the car were impressive there is always room for improvement particularly as we handle the new 2015 nose regulations '
The design of the FW37 has stemmed from the performance of the FW36 but the conceptual ideas came long before the 2014 successes.
'The first conceptual stage of the FW37 came before the FW36 had turned a wheel. The main element to this is understanding the rule changes and how they will affect the design of the car, from here we can start see if our ideas will fit within the regulations.'
The performance of the FW36 in 2014 saw the team move forward from ninth in the Constructors' Championship to third, obtaining nine podiums throughout the season and a front row lockout at the Austrian Grand Prix.
'The desire to beat Ferrari to third place in the Constructors' in 2014 meant we pushed our development through to late autumn, but the size of the team is now at a point where it was able to sustain this development whilst still working on the FW37.'
With the regulations relatively stable from 2014 the team went about developing the FW36 with the additional changes necessary to meet the 2015 rules.
'We felt we came up against design barriers in the FW36 and so took the opportunity to remove those barriers for the benefit of the performance. The FW36 carried a reasonable amount of ballast, so we were able to make alterations to the design for added performance without the fear of adding excessive mass.'"
Caterham CT05 Renault,"CT05, the Caterham F1 Team car that Kamui Kobayashi and Marcus Ericsson will be competing with in the 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship was unveiled in Jerez, Spain.
The first car to be fully designed and built at Caterham's Leafield Technical Centre, CT05 is the team's answer to the all-new F1 regulations that have come into force in 2014. The car will race in Caterham's new all-green 2014 livery and, for the fourth year in a row, will be powered by Renault Sport F1, using the new Renault Energy F1 engine mated to a Red Bull Technology gearbox.
Cyril Abiteboul, Team Principal and CEO, Caterham F1 Team: ""Unveiling CT05 is a proud moment for me and the whole team, especially with both F1 and Caterham entering a new era in 2014. Our shareholders and partners have made major investments in the people and facilities at Leafield, giving us a platform to work on the 2014 car that is now much closer to many of the teams ahead and, this year, there is no reason for this to not materialize directly to performance on track.
""We believe CT05 is a good starting point for us to deal with the new regulations and their associated challenges, in particular in terms of reliability. We have a lot of very talented people at Leafield who have worked tirelessly to bring this car to life and everyone has played a part in helping us exceed all the targets we set. We obviously won't know where we really are in relation to the other teams until the first race, but we believe we have answered the challenges presented by the new regulations as effectively as we can.
""We also have very good reason to be positive about how this car will develop throughout the season ahead. Thanks to our relocation in 2012 to at the core of the ""F1 valley"", and a highly selective recruitment plan, our staff are now a good mix of experience and young talent and we have moved our wind-tunnel program to the Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG) facility in Cologne, Germany. This means we are now working at 60% scale, a significant improvement over our previous facility and another sign of just how serious we are about making real progress this year. In addition to the TMG move is an improved partnership with Dell / Intel which gives us, among many other benefits, a major upgrade to our CFD capability, a critical part of our design toolbox that is even more important this year with the rule changes governing wind-tunnel use in 2014.
""In Renault Sport F1 and Red Bull Technology we have technical partners that have powered the World Championship winning team for the last four years, and, while we are realistic enough to know we are very unlikely to be competing right at the front of the grid, there is no reason why we should not be fighting higher than we have done since we came into the sport in 2010. We have extensive experience of working with both Renault and Red Bull and that is going to be crucial this year. Reliability and energy management will play a key role in 2014, especially early in the season, so our experience of working so closely with both organisations since 2011 will definitely help throughout the course of the season."
Ferrari F14 T,"The F14 T is the sixtieth car built by Ferrari specifically to take part in the Formula 1 World Championship. The name comes from the combination of the current year and the introduction of the turbo-compressor in the Power Unit.
Although the traditional gestation period for a new Formula 1 design is a little over twelve months, this project, which goes by the internal code name 665, began life more than two years ago. 2014 is an exceptional year in the history of the sport, with a raft of rule changes that commanded an early start to allow the ground up revision of every aspect of the car's design. To cope with the unprecedented challenge of running three car projects simultaneously during 2012, the Scuderia was fortunate to be able to call on the talents of experienced engineers to guide the project in its early stages.
Followers of the Scuderia will be able to see some of the heritage of earlier Ferrari designs in the F14 T - the obvious areas of continuity are the pull-rod front and rear suspension. However, beyond this superficial similarity there is little to connect the 2014 car to its predecessors. Externally, the car is very different to the cars of recent years: changes to the regulations to lower the chassis and nose in the interests of driver safety give the F14 T a very different appearance to the F138 and presented the designers with a real challenge to repackage the front suspension into a much lower monocoque. The 2014 rear wing family shares nothing with the previous year owing to three rule changes requiring a much larger stroke DRS, a much smaller overall rear wing depth and removal of the beam wing, thereby requiring the main plane to be supported by central pillars. The front wing is regulated to be 75mm narrower per side in order to make it less vulnerable to collisions with other cars and with the barriers. This change, perhaps one of the less noticeable visual differences to the 2013 cars, has a profound effect on the aerodynamics of the vehicle. The front wings used since 2009 have all featured elaborate measures to encourage the wake of the front wing endplates to pass around the outside of the front tyres in order to maximize the downforce on the car. An innocent change of just 75mm to the position of the wing tip has required us to reinvent completely the front wing aerodynamics for 2014.
Although the external differences are striking, the largest areas of difference occur beneath the skin of the car. The new car has completely different cooling requirements from any of its predecessors. Engine oil and water radiators shrink in size to match the relatively smaller V6 internal combustion part of the Power Unit. However, new homes had to be found to accommodate an intercooler for the turbo-compressor system and to manage heat rejection from ERS components that are many times greater than their KERS antecedents. Given that more cooling allows more horsepower, but more cooling also damages downforce generation it was necessary to decide very carefully on the correct level of overall cooling for the car to render the best lap time compromise between horsepower and downforce. This is one of the key areas where having both Power Unit and Chassis under one roof has been strongly to the benefit of the Scuderia. Having chosen the correct overall level of cooling to supply, packaging the resultant cooler elements and managing the correct airflow to them is something which has absorbed a very large investment of design time to ensure that the F14 T is able to retain the sharply tapered bodywork that allows efficient extraction of downforce from the design."
Force India VJM07 Mercedes,"Sahara Force India revealed its dynamic new look, offering fans and media a first impression of how the VJM07 will look when it is officially presented at next week's Jerez test session.
The new livery brings a fresh trackside image for the team with the introduction of black alongside the traditional colours of saffron, white and green.
""The VJM07 looks stunning and the new livery reflects the way Sahara Force India is evolving,"" says Vijay Mallya. ""I've always believed our cars have been the most eye-catching, but adding black as a main colour gives us a fierce new look.""
Key to the new look is the introduction of several commercial partners. The logo of telecommunications brand, Claro, appears on the engine cover and signals the start of a multi-year deal with the famous Mexican brand. There will be prominent Claro branding on the drivers' suits and team kit.
The rear wing end plate now includes branding from Roshfrans, the lubricant oils specialists, following last week's announcement of a multi-year partnership with the team.
The new livery also sees branding from Astana, a foundation that supports sporting initiatives by promoting the capital city of Kazakhstan. The Astana logo is positioned on the side of the VJM07's nose.
""It's been a busy winter for us on the technical and commercial front,"" explains Vijay. ""When I founded the team my first ambition was to launch the first Indian team on the grid, but the next stage in our evolution is to develop a global brand. I think that ambition is reflected in the partners we are working with and our world class driver line-up. It certainly feels as though there is the potential for 2014 to be our strongest season yet.""
As well as new colours, the changes beneath the skin of the VJM07 are even more extensive due to the new technical regulations. ""The new rules have presented us with a huge challenge, but I'm very proud of the approach we have taken and the direction of the technical team,"" says Vijay. ""It will be fascinating to see how different teams have interpreted the rules and at this stage it's impossible to predict who has done the best job.""
Technical Director, Andrew Green, is quick to emphasise just how different the VJM07 is compared to its predecessor: ""Almost every single part is a new design, from the front wing right back to the diffuser. The genetics of the VJM07 still lie in the 2013 car, but we've had to achieve the same results in a slightly different way.""
Andrew says accommodating the power unit was the biggest challenge: ""It's been a massive job to accommodate all the changes to the power unit - it's the biggest change I've witnessed in the sport since I started in 1990. Cooling has been the biggest challenge with most of last summer taken up trying to understand the cooling requirements of the power unit, and how best to optimise it in the chassis."""
Lotus E22 Renault,"Following a season of ups and downs that started with Kimi Raikkonen's victory in the Australian Grand Prix and ended with considerable concerns of the team's financial future, Lotus F1 also faced the herculean task of creating a brand new car built to a completely revised set of regulations. These included the introduction of a complicated turbo and hybrid drivetrain and more subtle changes to aero regulations.
Supplied by longtime Lotus partner, Renault, the new-for-2014 power unit consists of a V6 engine, displacing 1.6 litre and equipped with a single turbocharger. The associated hybrid system is altogether more complicated as energy can be generated by both the turbo and in braking zones. The energy stored can be used to feed extra power to the rear wheels but also to control the speed of the turbo to reduce lag. With an eye on increasing efficiency, both the fuel load and fuel flow is limited, while the hybrid system can store twice the amount of energy as can be harvested in a single lap.
Mated to an equally new 8-speed gearbox, the Renault power unit is bolted to a conventional carbon-fibre and aluminium honeycomb monocoque as a fully stressed member. Dubbed the E22, the new Lotus has conventional front and rear suspension with push-rod actuated dampers at the front and pull-rods at the rear. For safety reasons, the new regulations also stipulated the use of a lower nose, while designers previously had created raised noses to improve aero efficiency. This has resulted in some very unusual creations, of which Lotus' two-fingered was the most unusual. Although initial concerns over its legality were raised, it was deemed to meet the regulations.
Taking in account the amount of work needed to build the all-new Lotus E22 Renault, the team opted to sit out the opening test at Jerez. In retrospect, this was a smart move as the Renault power unit had some serious issues and most other Renault-powered teams only completed a few laps. The E22 finally broke cover at the Bahrain test halfway through February where it was driven by Romain Grosjean and new signing Pastor Maldonado."
Marussia MR03 Ferrari,"The MR03 is the Marussia F1 Team's design response to the dramatic and far-reaching technical regulation changes of 2014, the most significant of which is the departure of the normally-aspirated engines which have prevailed in the sport since 1988, in favour of a new, more road-relevant powertrain system, underpinned by a 1.6 litre turbo-charged V6 power-unit.
The process of conceiving the MR03 began in early 2012 when a small 2014-focused design group initiated the very first chassis layouts. 12 months on, as the 2014 Technical Regulations began to take shape, an exciting new powertrain partnership was forged with Scuderia Ferrari and the design process gained greater traction, in parallel with the 2013 Grand Prix season and development of the MR02.
The technical changes from 2013 to 2014 are significant for every team, and while they represent a considerable challenge, according to Team Principal John Booth, they are also an exciting opportunity for the young and ambitious design teams at the Marussia Technical Centre in Banbury, operating to a business model that demands efficiencies in every area:
""As we saw in the step from 2012 to 2013, we have young but experienced and extremely talented technical and engineering groups within the Marussia F1 Team, who have contributed enormously to our rate of progression over the past couple of years. To have designed a car that is true to the concept first conceived in early 2012, despite the integration of an entirely new powertrain and whilst pushing hard to attain our 2013 Constructors' Championship objective, is a testament to the extent to which we have matured as a technical organisation.""
The extent of evolution between the 2013 and 2014 cars can best be characterised by the fact that, of the 11,212 components that made up the MR02, only a handful of assemblies have been carried over to the MR03. The result, as Chief Designer John McQuilliam highlights, is the Team's ""best-ever optimisation of performance versus innovation versus design integrity.""
""Through the course of 2012,"" he continues, ""we analysed every single element of the car - from the tip of the nose to the trailing edge of the rear wing - knowing just how radically different the MR03 would be under such sweeping Technical Regulations. We have benefitted enormously from the stability of our design teams, with the same personnel beginning - and now concluding - the process over a 24 month period. I think we can feel justifiably proud of the way we have responded to such a significant challenge and the quality of car we have arrived at with the MR03.
""The car has been manufactured and finished to a very high standard, whilst achieving our most significant weight-saving targets to date and, importantly, with a crucial eye towards maintaining our excellent record of reliability.
""Without doubt, the greatest design challenge has been in terms of cooling, yet this is one of a few areas where we are not only very pleased with the design response, but also the degree of innovation we have achieved with our solution.
""All-new front and rear suspension layouts are a product of the new aerodynamic regulations placing greater emphasis on mechanical performance, with the mechanical systems now having far greater real road relevance."""
McLaren MP4-29 Mercedes,"A period of unprecedented change - both in Formula 1 and within the team itself - is the backdrop against which McLaren launches its latest grand prix challenger, the all-new MP4-29.
Gone are normally aspirated engines - a Formula 1 mainstay for a quarter of a century; in their place come 1.6-litre V6 power-units, which sophisticatedly integrate turbo-charging and turbo-compounding, fuel-flow restrictions, and a powerful energy recovery system.
These new regulations will enable teams to harness both traditional internal combustion and electrical energies. They further underline Formula 1's relevance as a pioneer of future roadcar technologies, represent the biggest and most dynamic change to the sport since its inception in 1950, and are duly destined to re-shape grand prix racing.
McLaren, too, faces a period of dynamic change: the organisation has not only embraced the extreme technical and strategic challenges posed by the new regulations, it has simultaneously been growing and developing ahead of even bigger and more exciting future partnerships.
McLaren have responded to the disappointment of our 2013 season by pragmatically framing our approach to the technical challenge. The new MP4-29 is a sensible and calculated response to the new regulations.
But it is very much a frozen snapshot of the design team's steep development curve, and, as such, a machine that will potentially undergo more technical change throughout a single season than any other car in McLaren's long and illustrious history.
The challenge for 2014 is to build-in both performance and reliability - something that can no longer be taken for granted given the steep technical challenge ahead.
And that is entirely as it should be: for this season will be Formula 1's steepest-ever learning curve.
It is also a time of transition. The final season with engine partner, Mercedes-Benz, will be the 20th together, before McLaren begin an exciting new journey with Honda from 2015."
Mercedes-Benz W05,"The Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team unveiled the F1 W05, its 2014 challenger, at the Circuito de Jerez in southern Spain. Ahead of the first morning of official winter testing, Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton took the wraps off the first all-new Silver Arrow to hit the track since 1954. Designed from the ground up as an integrated project between the Mercedes-Benz teams based at Brackley and Brixworth, this new car marks an historic milestone in a landmark year when Mercedes-Benz celebrates 120 years of Motorsport and the 80th anniversary of the Silver Arrows.
The 2014 Formula One season marks the biggest change in regulations in the sport's history and the F1 W05 has been designed to meet the challenge of this technical revolution. The initial engineering conversations between the teams at Brackley and Brixworth around both the regulations and potential solutions date back to late 2010. Since mid-2011, when the rules for the new V6 Hybrid Power Unit were officially published, Mercedes-Benz has taken a fully integrated approach to every major performance decision with a clear-sighted focus on maximising overall car performance.
The result is the new F1 W05 and, at its heart, the PU106A Hybrid Power Unit, both designed to meet the challenge of a fundamental change in the philosophy of Formula One. The introduction of a demanding maximum race fuel allowance of just 100 kg per race, coupled with a maximum fuel flow rate of 100 kg/hour, have focused the efforts of the sport's engineers on delivering performance with a set of innovative new technologies that achieve an efficiency gain of more than 30%.
The F1 W05 will therefore deliver over one third more performance from every unit of fuel consumed, a development story that places the new Hybrid Formula One at the cutting edge of automotive technology - and puts the sport on the same development path as the wider automotive industry.
Toto Wolff, Executive Director (Business) of Mercedes AMG Petronas and Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport, commented:
""It is always exciting to pull the wraps off a new car for the first time but even more so at the start of this momentous 2014 season. Our new Silver Arrow is the result of a single-minded, integrated approach between our engineering teams. My compliments and thanks go to every team member in Brackley, at Brixworth and also at our key partner, Petronas, for their hard work to deliver this new car and the Power Unit at its heart; it is the result of several years of intense effort. But we know that the adventure has only just begun. We have a busy winter testing period ahead of us and a long season where both performance and reliability will be critically important. Lewis and Nico begin the season hungry for success and I am confident that our team will benefit thanks to the continuity of their work during the winter period. We have positive momentum after our second-place finish last season. Our clear target is to continue building up our team and we aim to deliver on every single race weekend in 2014.""
""For 2014 we have probably the greatest change in regulations in Formula One history and the start of a new era for our sport,"" continued Executive Director (Technical) Paddy Lowe. ""From a technical and also a racing perspective, this is an incredibly exciting time for Formula One. We are introducing technologies that are new not just to racing but to the wider automotive world as well. The headline is that of improved efficiency and the fact that we will be completing races with advanced Hybrid systems on just 100 kg of fuel sends a great message about the technology that Formula One can deliver. But it is also about the technology that Mercedes-Benz can develop compared with our competition, both for the chassis and the new Power Unit. The whole team has done a fantastic job on the management of the project and its delivery. We have hit our milestones and hit our targets but, as ever, we will only begin to understand how successful we have been once we begin running in anger on track. The new car is an elegant but aggressive design and, as is often the way, its beauty is much more than skin deep; the internal engineering of the car is extremely innovative and intelligent. Our team can be justifiably proud of its work so far - but none of us are under any illusions about the amount we still have to do before the first race in six weeks' time."""
Red Bull Racing RB10 Renault,"For Red Bull Racing, the 2014 Formula 1 season will be the team's tenth. In the previous five years, it fielded the quickest car, winning the Drivers' and Constructors' World Championships the last four season. These success were achieved with what were very much evolutions of the same Adrian Newey design. Major regulation changes meant that Red Bull Racing could not continue on the same foot, prompting Newey's design department to effectively start from scratch to create the new-for-2014 RB10.
One of the main challenges Newey faced was integrating the altogether more complex drivetrain into the chassis. Instead of the relatively straightforward naturally aspirated V8s previously used, the new regulations stipulated the use of smaller, turbocharged V6 engines. As part of the new power unit is a more complicated hybrid system that works in two ways. Similar to the previous KERS system, an electric motor, now twice as powerful, is used to harvest braking energy. A second motor is connected to the turbocharger, which can be used to also harvest energy and control the turbine speed and prevent lag as well.
As before, the power unit fitted to the RB10 is supplied by longtime partner Renault, who have come to consider Red Bull Racing as their primary team. The turbocharged internal combustion engine is equipped with a direct injection and displaces 1.6 litre. It should be good for around 600 bhp, while the electric motor can produce an additional of 160 bhp. With an eye on efficiency, a car can only use 100 kg of fuel per race and the maximum fuel flow itself is also limited. A further complication is that twice as much energy can be stored than a driver is allowed to harvest in a lap. As a result, managing the available fuel and electric energy will form a critical part of the strategy.
More than any other team, Red Bull Racing had managed to utilise the airflow of the exhausts to generate downforce. The new V6 engine, however, has a single, high-mounted exhaust, which can no longer be used to blow the diffuser. Further changes to the aerodynamics include a mandatory narrower front wing and a lower nose to prevent cars from launching off the back of another car in case of an accident. Especially the latter has led to some controversial solutions but by using some carefully placed paint, Newey solution is one of the most visually pleasing. The final aerodynamics package is only expected to appear at the start of the first race in March.
In addition to fielding an all-new car for the first time in many years, the Red Bull Racing line-up has also changed. Four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel will be joined by Australian Daniel Ricciardo, who replaces compatriot Mark Webber."
Sauber C33 Ferrari,"On its website the Sauber F1 Team presented the new Sauber C33-Ferrari with which its two drivers, Esteban Gutiérrez (MX, 22) and Adrian Sutil (DE, 31), will be lining up on the grid for the start of the 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship. The team has signed up Giedo van der Garde (NL, 28) as its test and reserve driver as well as Sergey Sirotkin (RU, 18) as test driver. The Sauber C33-Ferrari will be rolled out in Jerez de la Frontera (ES) during the first winter test starting on 28th January.
Looking ahead to the new season, Team Principal Monisha Kaltenborn said: ""We have put a very challenging year behind us. The first half of 2013 in particular was difficult for us, but the second half saw us making significant strides. We learnt a great deal during this time and will be applying the lessons in the new season.""
But the Team Principal is careful to make any forecasts for the new season: ""Due to the radical changes in the technical regulations, predictions are simply impossible to make at this stage. Even more so than in previous years, any impression of how the teams stand against each other will only emerge once winter testing has been completed. That is also when we will announce our goals for the 2014 season. One thing's for sure: reliability will be of the essence, especially at the beginning of the season.""
Kaltenborn is optimistic about the new brace of drivers: ""Adrian is somebody we've been observing for some time and with whom we've been in contact since September. That is why I'm particularly delighted we've managed to get him on board. He has repeatedly demonstrated just how fast he is, and he isn't lacking in experience either, being about to enter his seventh season. In the light of the far-reaching technical changes, that is an advantage not to be underestimated.""
""As for Esteban Gutiérrez,"" the Team Principal continued, ""we have long considered him to be a talented racing driver. We know him extremely well as his connections with our team go back several years. Last year he had a difficult start, but managed to steadily progress. He has also settled into the team very well. We are confident he can now turn his experience into good results.""
Adrian Sutil is delighted with his move to the Sauber F1 Team: ""After six good years in the same team, it was time for me to look for a new challenge. I'm determined to have a successful future with the Sauber F1 Team and will do my bit to ensure that. In recent years the team has repeatedly demonstrated its potential, not least in the second half of the last season. And as for infrastructure, the Sauber F1 Team are a match for anybody. I can't wait to take on the challenge!""
""Last season I had a steep learning curve,"" said Esteban Gutiérrez, ""but working together with the team, I was able to make steady progress. This is my fourth year with the Swiss team, and the second as a racing driver. Last year I learnt a great deal and I feel ready for the next step. The 2014 season will be a huge challenge on the technical front, which makes it all the more important to know the people you work with well. I will do everything I can to improve further and to support the team with all the resources I have.""
On January 21st, the team announced Giedo van der Garde as its test and reserve driver. Team Principal Monisha Kaltenborn said: ""Giedo has four years of experience in GP2 and he drove one year in Formula One. These are good credentials to work successfully with our team. Many times Giedo has shown his talent as a race driver. At the same time the team would like to support him to further develop his skills. Giedo has the right attitude to take the next step forward.""
Taking on the role of test driver is 18-year-old Sergey Sirotkin of Russia. ""Last year Sergey already had a chance to glean a first-hand impression of Formula One,"" said Monisha Kaltenborn. ""He spent several days in the factory, spoke at length with our engineers, was with the team at the Italian Grand Prix and drove 60 laps in a Ferrari in Fiorano. Our aim, as before, is to prepare him for entry into Formula One."""
Toro Rosso STR9 Renault,"In a change from last season, Scuderia Toro Rosso will be powered by Renault in 2014. The STR9 will be equipped with the Renault Energy F1-2014 Power Unit, a brand new power plant designed by the Renault Sport F1 team at Viry-Chatillon, France, in line with the radical new technical regulations applicable from this season. The Energy F1 combines a powerful turbocharged internal combustion engine with potent energy recovery systems harvesting energy from exhaust and braking. For the first time, cars will be powered by both traditional fuel and sustained electrical energy.
V6 is shorthand for an internal combustion engine arranged in two banks of 3 cylinders in a 'V' configuration over a common crankshaft. The Renault Energy F1 V6 has a displacement of 1.6 litres and will make around 600bhp. This year, all Power Units must have direct fuel injection (DI), where fuel is sprayed directly into the combustion chamber rather than into the inlet port upstream of the inlet valves. This is a key sub-system at the heart of the fuel efficiency and power delivery of the power unit.
A turbocharger uses exhaust gas energy to increase the density of the engine intake air and therefore produce more power. Similar to the principle employed on roadcars, the turbocharger allows a smaller engine to make much more power than its size would permit if normally aspirated. The exhaust energy produced is converted to mechanical shaft power by an exhaust turbine. This mechanical power is then used to drive the compressor, and also the MGU-H. An intercooler is used to cool the engine intake air after it has been compressed by the turbocharger before it goes into the inlet duct. On conventional turbo engines, a wastegate is used in association with a turbocharger. It is a control device that allows excess exhaust gas to by-pass the turbine and match the power produced by the turbine to that needed by the compressor to supply the air required by the engine. On the Renault Energy F1, the turbo rotation speed is primarily controlled by the MGU-H (see below). However a wastegate is still needed to keep full control in any circumstance (such as quick transient or MGU-H deactivation).
The MGU-K is connected to the crankshaft of the internal combustion engine. Under braking, the MGU-K operates as a generator, recovering some of the kinetic energy usually dissipated during braking. It converts this into electricity that can be deployed throughout the lap (limited to 120 kW or 160bhp by the rules). Under acceleration, the MGU-K is powered from the Energy Store and/or from the MGU-H and acts as a motor to propel the car.
The MGU-H is connected to the turbocharger. Acting as a generator, it absorbs power through the turbine shaft coming from the conversion of the heat energy from the exhaust gases. The electrical energy can be either directed to the MGU-K or to the battery for storage for later use. The MGU-H is also used to control the speed of the turbocharger to match the air requirement of the engine (eg to slow it down in place of a wastegate or to accelerate it to compensate for turbo lag.)
Heat and Kinetic Energy recovered can be consumed immediately if required or used to charge the Energy Store, or battery. The stored energy can be used to propel the car with the MGU-K or to accelerate the turbocharger with the MGU-H. Compared to 2013 KERS, the ERS of the 2014 power unit will have twice the power (120 kW vs 60 kW) and the energy contributing to performance is ten times greater."
Williams FW36 Mercedes,"Williams today released the first images of its 2014 challenger: the Williams Mercedes FW36. The FW36 is one of the most technologically advanced Formula One cars produced by Williams. It is the culmination of more than two years research and development by the team's technical departments in Grove and it incorporates the power unit from the team's new partner, Mercedes-Benz.
""There's a lot more technology on the cars this year,"" says Williams Chief Technical Officer Pat Symonds. ""We've had turbo-charged engines in F1 before; what's different this time is that it is much more than just an engine change, it is a completely different system. We've gone from a slightly hybridised normally aspirated engine to a fully integrated hybrid power unit with novel technology at its heart.""
To meet the challenges of the new power unit, Williams signed the deal with Mercedes Benz High Performance Powertrains midway through last season. The team received the first CAD (Computer-Aided Design) data for the power unit at the end of May, at which point the detailed design of the FW36 could begin to be finalised.
""This is the first time that Williams has worked with Mercedes in F1 and we've been very impressed,"" says Symonds. ""Their professionalism and commitment have been notable and we're as confident as we can be that the power unit will be competitive.""
The design phase of the FW36 was completed by mid-September, by which time the team had found solutions to the major challenges presented by the regulations. Cooling, weight, a new gearbox and aerodynamic changes are just some of the areas of focus.
""Overall the cars will need more cooling this year,"" says Symonds. ""The demands on water and oil cooling may be slightly diminished, but the ERS system is significantly more powerful and hence needs more cooling. We also have to cool the charge air from the turbocharger compressor which requires a substantial intercooler."""
Caterham CT03 Renault,"CT03, Caterham F1 Team's 2013 race car, was unveiled in the pitlane of the Circuito de Jerez, Spain, on day one of the first official 2013 pre-season test. The car was revealed by the team's race drivers Charles Pic, who will race in car #20, and Giedo van der Garde who will be in car #21 for the forthcoming season.
The 2013 car has technical features that distinguish it from its predecessor, CT01, and it will race in an updated livery which sees the team's green and yellow paint-scheme refreshed and lightened for the season ahead.
Mark Smith, Technical Director, Caterham F1 Team: ""CT03 is the first car we have produced in the Leafield Technical Centre so it marks an important milestone in the development of our team. The season ahead presented us with an interesting challenge early in the design process as it is the last year of the current regulations before the introduction of the new engine rules in 2014. With that in mind we decided that CT03 would be an evolution of CT01 rather than a complete re-design, allowing us to focus our resources on developing areas of last year's package where opportunities would give us the greatest return, whilst also beginning work on the 2014 package.
""We have made a number of significant changes to the car that takes it from the package that gained us tenth place in the 2012 Championship in Brazil into CT03. Among the most obvious are around the lower chassis where the sidepods have been significantly undercut to improve airflow to the rear of the car. The diffuser, engine cover and cooling exits have also seen major changes and there are more subtle improvements to other areas of the car, such as the sidepod turning vanes and the lower tea-tray area. This is the package we will take to race one in Australia and as part of the 2013 upgrade program we will then bring new front and rear wings and a new diffuser soon after the start of the season.
""However, the CT03 car that starts testing in Spain on day one in Jerez is not the only visible change amongst a number of other important developments at Caterham this winter. Back in Leafield, we are fast completing our own 'driver in the loop' simulator, created with the support of Dell and powered by Alienware. This is a major asset for our team that puts us on a par with any of our competitors and constitutes another example of the long-term plans we are activating that will help us continue to grow and develop into the team we know we can become.
""Personally I am excited about the season ahead, and the challenges that face us. Regardless of the resources and budget available, all the teams will be racing in 2013 with one eye on next year when the new rules may present opportunities to make significant gains, much greater than those available under static rules. Our whole team is ready for its fourth season in F1 and I am sure it is going to be another thrilling championship.""
Cyril Abiteboul, Team Principal, Caterham F1 Team: ""This is the first car we have produced since I joined the team so this is a proud day for me. I am very pleased that we have been able to allocate our resources and budgets as efficiently as possible to produce a car that will allow us to consolidate our position in Formula One whilst also starting work on the 2014 car as early as possible.
""From the outside, the most obvious change to CT03 car is the livery. Whilst retaining the green and yellow paint scheme that has become synonymous with our team since 2010, we have refreshed both colours to enhance their visibility on track and give them what will be, we believe, one of the best looking liveries in the pitlane.
""Driving the cars this year are Charles Pic and Giedo van der Garde, two drivers who give us a good mix of youth and experience inside and outside Formula One. Charles and Giedo are both young and dynamic and we expect that their enthusiasm for the sport and the team will be fuelling our growth. Additionally, they provide clear proof of our dedication to developing young driver talent and now, any aspiring driver who dreams of F1 can see that there is a clear route to the F1 grid under the guidance of the Caterham Driver Development Program, the 2013 format of which will soon be presented.""
""Off track our team is in a healthy position. We are still a small team but our stated objective is to be the most efficient of all F1 Teams, and thanks to our determination, our scalability and our processes, there is no reason we cannot achieve this in recognition of the ongoing investments our shareholders and team partners make in us.
""We have partners in GE / Safran, EADS / Airbus, Dell / Intel, McGregor and Renault who are the envy of the pitlane. Our relationships with each of those businesses continue to develop and we are delighted that such blue-chip brands share our vision and are an integral part of our team.
""As part of Caterham Group we are also involved in the Renault / Caterham Cars partnership, one of the most exciting projects in the global motoring industry and one that means we start the 2013 season as one of the five car-makers on the F1 grid.
""The move to Leafield was the last big piece of the jigsaw, and now we are settled in our new, permanent home, we are in the process of increasing our integration level to better control the quality, cost, and lead time of our supply chain. I am confident that this will ultimately translate into faster laptimes to reduce the gap with the midfield cars. CT03 is the first car to be built in Leafield and while we are realistic enough to know that we are not going to be the fastest car on the grid, we do think we will have one of the best looking cars in 2013. I will be working so that one day we have both!""
Tony Fernandes, Co-Chairman, Caterham Group: ""This is the first car we have produced from our factory in Leafield and the last we will build under the current regulations. The team has produced a car that is an evolution of the 2012 car, building on that platform to give us a chance of continuing to make progress towards the teams ahead, whilst also dedicating enough resource to start work as early as possible on the 2014 car.
""For me this is going to be the story of the 2013 season - every team wants to be as competitive as possible this year, but with such fundamental rule changes next year resources and budgets dictate that there will have to be a cut-off point in the development of the current season cars so focus can be switched to 2014. We will bring updates to the car after several races and I am happy that the plan we have for 2013 will give us the chance to fight this year, but, importantly, will allow us to take full advantage of the new rules in 2014.
""Having stepped up to the role of Co-Chairman of Caterham Group I will be playing less of a day-to-day role with the team but I am delighted that we go into our fourth season in such a strong position. Caterham Group continues to grow and since launching our partnership with Renault in November we have started work on the new Alpine and Caterham Cars products which is obviously very exciting. Caterham Composites and Caterham Technology & Innovation are also forging ahead with a number of very interesting projects, some of which will be unveiled throughout 2013.
""I am realistic enough to know that we still have a long journey ahead of us, but the dream is steadily coming true. We have invested in the long-term, not taken any short-cuts and we have everything in place to keep moving forwards."""
Ferrari F138,"The F138 is the fifty ninth car built by Ferrari specifically to take part in the Formula 1 World Championship. The name comes from a combination of the current year and the number of cylinders, to mark the fact that this is the eighth and final year of competition for the V8 engine configuration.
The project, which goes by the internal code name 664, is the first design to come from the reorganisation concerning working methods that has been in operation for several months, with the creation of two distinct groups of designers: one working on this car and the other on the completely different car which will race next season. This car constitutes the Scuderia's interpretation of this year's Technical and Sporting Regulations, which in fact are substantially the same as those from last season. Therefore the F138 can be seen as an evolution of the F2012, in terms of its basic design principals, although every single part has been revised in order to maximise performance, while maintaining all the characteristics which were the basis of last season's extraordinary reliability.
The design philosophy of the suspension layout has not changed and it continues to use pull-rods both front and rear, but it has been refined to the limit, in order to gain as much aerodynamic advantage as possible, especially at the rear. The bodywork elements have been redesigned to allow for changes to the positioning and layout of the exhausts. The dynamic air intake, mounted above the cockpit has been redesigned, as have been the intakes to the side pods, which in turn have also been optimised in aerodynamic terms, while maintaining unchanged the overall cooling system.
The rear of the car is much narrower and more tapered on the lower part. The configuration of the front and rear wings derives directly from the last versions used on the F2012, partly because development of that car ran all the way to the final race of last season. However, the aerodynamic elements shown on the car are only those from the initial phase of development: significant modifications will be introduced in the weeks leading up to the first race and a busy development programme is already planned. The drag reduction system on the rear wing has been revised and optimised to make the most of the modifications to the Sporting Regulations that come into play this year. There are detailed changes to the design of the brake ducts, both front and rear and work has been carried out with Brembo on optimising the braking system overall. During both the design and production stages, great attention has been paid to weight reduction and on increasing rigidity. This theme was carried out through all departments working together - Chassis, Engine and Electronics and Production - which bears witness to the importance of being able to design and build a car with everyone working side by side in the same place, which has always been the case at Ferrari.
The engine on the F138 is an evolution of the one fitted to the car last year, inevitably given that the technical regulations forbid modifications to internal components aimed at improving performance. Given the consequent difficulty of finding performance increases through internal modifications, work was intensified on ensuring that the engine's performance level remained as high as possible throughout the lifecycle of each power unit, which has now reached an average life of three races.
The kinetic energy recovery system retains its location in the lower-central part of the car, a strategic choice which has always been adopted by the team, partly with the aim of ensuring maximum safety. Once again this year, a great deal of effort has gone into reducing its weight and size, at the same time improving the efficiency of some of its components and, as in the case of the engine, maintaining the highest performance level throughout the KERS usage cycle. The technical collaboration with Shell, which has run for several decades now, has led to further progress on the fuel and lubricants front, aimed at increasing performance in overall terms and also on maintaining it throughout the engine's life, as well as reducing consumption.
As for the electronics, it is worth noting the introduction, ahead of schedule, of the single control unit that will be used in 2014. This has involved a lot of work to integrate and control all its features in terms of both software and hardware. In keeping with a Ferrari tradition, much time has been dedicated to the performance and improvement of the materials used, at the design stage of each of the six thousand or so components which make up the car, in order to make all the on-track work more effective and efficient. Obviously, quality control remains a vital aspect, with the aim of achieving the highest levels of performance and reliability, at the same time as maintaining the highest safety standards possible.
With only twelve days of testing available before the start of the Championship, the preparatory work on the test benches prior to the car's track debut, has taken on even more importance. The three test sessions - at Jerez de la Frontera and Barcelona - will allow the team to get to understand the behaviour of the F138 and to adapt it to the new Pirelli tyres: in fact, tyre use is an area that has seen a lot of work both at the design stage and in its management at the track. Also very important and something that will not only be restricted to the winter months, has been the effort invested in areas that could influence the result of a Grand Prix, such as the team's pit stop work, reduction of time spent going through the pit lane, strategy management and the start procedure."
Force India VJM06 Mercedes,"Sahara Force India unveiled its 2013 challenger today as Paul Di Resta pulled the covers off the VJM06 at Silverstone circuit.
The VJM06 is the third car to be overseen by Technical Director, Andrew Green, and builds on the strengths of the 2012 car. With stable technical rules the car is more evolution than revolution with the removal of the 'step' nose being the most obvious visual change.
""The VJM06 doesn't look massively different to its predecessor, but beneath the skin we've looked at every detail to try and find more performance,"" says Team Principal, Dr Vijay Mallya. ""I've followed the development of the car closely and I'm proud of what we have achieved. The objective now is to make sure we build on the promise of last year and have a strong start to the season.""
Summing up the approach to the design of the VJM06, Andrew Green said: ""It's a brand new car from the ground-up - everything is new. We discussed carrying over big chunks of last year's car, including the chassis, but decided not to. There were still some gains to be had with the chassis, so we elected to take the performance benefits. The biggest change that everybody is going to notice this year is the fairing on top of the nose to hide the 'step'. It's neutral as far as the car's performance is concerned but tidies up the flow over the top of the chassis.""
Chief Operating Officer, Otmar Szafnauer, praised the team's efforts over the winter to develop the VJM06: ""We're very optimistic. We've been working hard over the winter, trying to make improvements where we know we can find performance. Everything has come together very nicely. We've also focussed on operational strength by bolstering our simulator programme and increasing our CFD capacity with new hardware.""
Paul Di Resta, half of the team's 2013 line-up, was delighted to see his new car: ""Seeing the car built and complete for the first time is a special feeling. I've followed its progress in the tunnel and it looks very impressive - aggressive and fast. Now I'm just eager to get out there and see where we stand compared to our competitors. After the winter I feel refreshed and keen to get back to business.""
The Sahara Force India cars will be powered by Mercedes engines with the gearbox supplied by McLaren Applied Technologies for a fifth season. This will be the third season with the Mercedes KERS."
Lotus E21 Renault,"The Lotus F1 Team E21 has been unleashed from the team's Enstone base in Oxfordshire, England.
Revealed to team partners on site, streamed live on YouTube and broadcast live on Sky Sports News in the UK, the E21 will contest the 2013 FIA Formula 1 World Championship with drivers Kimi Raikkonen (E21 #7) and Romain Grosjean (E20 #8).
With only limited changes to the technical and sporting regulations from 2012, the E21 continues the design themes seen in its race-winning predecessor, the E20. However, it is pushing last year's concepts even further as well as incorporating some innovative technical solutions. The new car also features a slightly tweaked livery, incorporating an extra touch or red.
Joining the team as Third Driver is reigning GP2 series champion Davide Valsecchi, whilst Nicolas Prost will perform Development Driver duties. Jerome D'Ambrosio will continue with the team as Reserve Driver.
Eric Boullier, Team Principal: ""I think it is fair to say that great things are possible from the team and the E21. The leap we made from 2011 to 2012 showed what we are capable of. Add to this the continuity and potential of our driver line-up and we have a very powerful cocktail for the season ahead. Our ambitious plan to turn ourselves into one of the top teams in Formula 1 is coming to fruition and now we need to harness this with strong and regular podium results.""
James Allison, Technical Director: ""The E20 proved itself to be an effective racing car - particularly towards the end of last season - so there is an element of expectation from the E21 and plenty to build upon. We have continued with our design themes and tried to create a more efficient and faster racing car based on all the lessons we learnt last year. How successful we have been in this task will only be discovered when we take to the track at the winter tests and - more significantly - at Grands Prix.""
Kimi Raikkonen, Race Driver: ""Of course, I've not driven the E21 yet so it's difficult to say what could or could not be possible for the year ahead. We know we had a good car last season, but everyone is working hard to make the best package. I will be working with the team to help get the car as strong as we can, then in Melbourne we'll have our first taste of results. It's a long season from there. 2012 was a good start; let's see what we can do in 2013.""
Romain Grosjean, Race Driver: ""I can clearly say I want to score a lot of points for the team - everybody knows that - but I think it would be wrong for me to say I want to finish in a particular position in the championship. I really want to jump out of the car as many times as possible thinking that I did a good job. Knowing that everything I could do, I did, and feeling proud of my race or session. I hope to feel that way as many times as possible this year."""
McLaren MP4-28 Mercedes,"Vodafone McLaren Mercedes launched its 2013 Formula 1 challenger and kicked off a year of 50th anniversary celebrations with a spectacular parade of classic racing cars at the McLaren Technology Centre.
The parade brought to life a string of race- and championship-winning McLarens from across the decades, included 1970's M8D CanAm sportscar, Emerson Fittipaldi's iconic 1974 M23, Ayrton Senna's dominant 1988 MP4/4, the 1995 Le Mans-winning F1 GTR, Mika Hakkinen's MP4-13 car from 1998 and Lewis Hamilton's 2008 MP4-23.
The display culminated in the arrival of the 2013 race drivers, Jenson Button and Sergio 'Checo' Perez - who arrived driving a development model of the new McLaren P1 sportscar and a 12C Spider, respectively.
The display of classic McLarens was a timely reminder of the weight of history that constantly hangs over a team with such high expectations each and every season. Following such a winning pedigree is the aim and intention of each and every man and woman who comes to work at McLaren every day.
And, for everyone involved in its inception, the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes MP4-28 is the logical culmination of everything McLaren ever done: it's the sum of 50 years' experience, expertise and passion.
The MP4-28 isn't merely a refinement of last year's seven-race-winning car, it's a deep and sweeping re-design of an already successful chassis in several key areas - most notably around the nose and front suspension, the sidepod profiles and the rear bodywork.
Jenson begins his fourth season at Vodafone McLaren Mercedes as the team's most experienced driver. Indeed, during his time here, he has won more races (eight) and scored more points (672) than during the rest of his 10-year Formula 1 career. For 2013, he is keenly anticipating the opportunity to maximise all his skill and depth of experience to spearhead the development of the car across the championship season.
By contrast, Checo is starting only his third season in Formula 1, aged 23. Young, eager to learn, and already impressing the team with his ability to absorb information, he is perfectly poised to benefit from the team's professionalism and experience as he develops and gathers pace during his important first season as a Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver.
McLaren will once again be targeting both the drivers' and constructors' world championships. The ongoing strength in depth of the organisation, plus the exciting addition of Sergio to the proven package of Jenson gives the whole team strong encouragement and motivation for the year ahead."
Mercedes-Benz W04,"Bolstered by a breakthrough victory during the 2012 season, team principal Ross Brawn continued building up the Mercedes-Benz Formula 1 team. Added to the staff were talented engineers Aldo Costa, Geoff Willis and Mike Elliott, while Toto Wolff took over from Norbert Haug as Vice President and Lewis Hamilton joined Nico Rosberg as driver. The first result of the restructured team was the Mercedes-Benz W04 Grand Prix car. It was the fourth car produced in Brackley after the German manufacturer had taken over. The W04 was also the last powered by the naturally aspirated V8 engine as the sport was ramping up to adapting a more efficient hybrid-turbo drivetrain.
The W04 was built around a carbon-fibre composite and aluminium honeycomb monocoque with the compact V8 engine and seven-speed gearbox serving as fully stressed members. The in-board springs and dampers were actuated by push-rods at the front while the rear-suspension boasted pull-rods for aerodynamic efficiency. The FO 108F V8 was assisted by a mild hybrid system, good for 80 hp. As per the regulations, the a very wide front was mounted under the raised nose while the tail boasted a relatively narrow and tall wing.
With Lewis Hamilton taking the seat vacated by Michael Schumacher, the German team started the season with a strong driver line-up. As during the previous three seasons, the Red Bull team had the edge. Hamilton scored a podium finish in only his second outing with the team and Rosberg took the first win of the year at the Monaco Grand Prix. He won again at Silverstone and then Hamilton scored a victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix. Although the W04 scored no more wins, at least one
Silver Arrow
finished in the points at every Grand Prix and the team ended the year a much improved second in the Constructors' Championship.
Heavily revised regulations were introduced for the 2014 season and the all-new W05 proved to be able to deliver the final push needed to dominate the sport. With three wins, the W04 was the most successful Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix car of the 2.4-litre V8 era and it helped Hamilton score his first of dozens of victories with the team."
Red Bull Racing RB9 Renault,"Infiniti Red Bull Racing set the defence of its Formula One Drivers' and Constructors' Championship titles in motion with the launch of its 2013 car, the RB9, in Milton Keynes UK.
In front of an audience of team members, partners, guests and international media, drivers Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber drew back the sheet to reveal the RB9, the final instalment in a generation of designs that have bought Infiniti Red Bull Racing 34 grand prix victories and six World Championships.
Nine times grand prix winner Mark and triple World Champion Sebastian were joined on stage by team principal Christian Horner, chief technical officer Adrian Newey and corporate vice president global marketing communications representing Infiniti, Simon Sproule.
Despite the largely unchanged nature of the technical regulations for 2013, Adrian Newey explained that the off-season was far from relaxed. ""It's a tribute to all the hard work of the guys over the winter because we had a very tight championship battle last year,"" he said. ""It was difficult trying to continue development of last year's car while also doing research into the RB9. Obviously it worked for us, but it gave us a very tight timeframe to design and manufacture this car.
""RB9 is an evolutionary car,"" he added. ""Probably the most significant change is not the regulations, but the new Pirelli tyres. We had a quick test with those in practice ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix but in truth we didn't learn a lot because of the conditions. Pirelli have supplied us data about how the new tyres behave but past experience tells us that it's only when we go testing that we really find out.""
The continuity in Infiniti Red Bull Racing's driver line-up for 2013 is much more straightforward. Sebastian is beginning his fifth year with the team, while this will be Mark's seventh straight season with Infiniti Red Bull Racing, the longest-established teamdriver combination on the 2013 grid.
""The fact that this is my seventh season with the team is a massive advantage,"" said Mark. ""I couldn't have envisaged it when I joined and it's hard to believe that you could be with the same Formula One team for seven years, as continuity is not always easy to achieve in this sport.
""I think the way we keep people excited and motivated here is important,"" he added. ""It's quite a small operation, but obviously we're big on ambition and desire and that makes us perform very well. I've really enjoyed the years I've had here so far and I can't wait to get going this season.""
After a thrilling climax to the 2012 season which saw Sebastian claim his third title in as many years, the sport's youngest ever triple world champion has had the opportunity to recharge his batteries over the last two months and professed himself more than ready to begin the task of trying to win a fourth straight title, something done only twice before in the history of the sport.
""We had a very strong finish last season, but it was hard as the season was so long - it was important for me to enjoy being home,"" he said. ""Pretty soon though I started training again, preparing for the new season and I'm very excited because this is the first time I've seen the car in one piece. I've seen little bits, but it looks very nice, so now we'll get to see if it works as expected. I'm excited to get going again, to get back in the car, start testing and then go racing. Then, we'll finally find out where we are.""
As Infiniti Red Bull Racing begins the defence of its world titles, Christian Horner emphasised the value of stability in the team. ""The 2012 season was tough and long, but our success was testimony to all the hard work and dedication in the factory,"" he said. ""We're fortunate that we've been able to maintain continuity within our group. This is the fifth year that this driver pairing has been together. We've got continuity throughout all of the technical teams and all the key areas. I think that's proof that there is a fierce determination to keep both of those trophies in the cabinet for another year.""
The team departs for southern Spain this evening, with testing of the RB9 due to commence at the Jerez de la Frontera circuit on Tuesday. Mark will give the car its track debut, driving on Tues 5 and Wed 6 February, with Sebastian taking over for the final two days, on Thurs 7 and Fri 8 February."
Sauber C32 Ferrari,"The Sauber F1 Team has presented the Sauber C32-Ferrari to its partners and the media on Saturday, 2nd February. Drivers Nico Hülkenberg (DE, 25) and Esteban Gutiérrez (MX, 21) pulled back the covers on the new car at the team's base in Hinwil, Switzerland. The roll-out of the Sauber C32 will take place during the first winter test at Jerez de la Frontera on 5th February.
""Two thousand and twelve was a very successful year for us,"" said Monisha Kaltenborn, looking ahead to the new season. ""We not only moved up from seventh to sixth place in the constructors' standings, but also improved our points total from 44 in 2011 to 126 last season. We have a strong platform in place now, on which we are aiming to build and continue our upward curve.""
The Team Principal is bullish about the prospects for the team's new driver pairing: ""We have had our eye on Nico Hülkenberg for some time and have been impressed by his performances. He is very quick, but, most importantly, he's also very efficient. He understands how to pick up as many points as possible from a particular race situation. Esteban Gutiérrez is a driver we know very well as a result of a relationship with the team going back several years, and he has already had a number of opportunities to test with our car. Plus, he has always stayed in close contact with our engineers, which has allowed him to learn a lot about Formula One. I'm in no doubt he is now ready to take the final step and put his outstanding talent on display.""
Gutiérrez has been succeeded as test and reserve driver by 21-year-old Dutchman Robin Frijns. ""We rate him as an extraordinarily gifted young man, so we decided to give him this opportunity,"" explained Kaltenborn. ""We will now set about introducing him step by step to life in Formula One.""
Hülkenberg is entering his third F1 season in a race seat. The German spent 2010 - his rookie year - with Williams and 2012 at the wheel of a Force India car. ""The Sauber F1 Team made significant progress last year from 2011,"" the German driver recognised. ""Now the team is ready to take the next step, and I want to play my part in making that happen. My personal aim is to put in a good, steady performance this season.""
Gutiérrez won the GP3 Championship with something to spare in 2010. He promptly made the move up to GP2 and finished third in last year's standings. Now the Mexican is focused on the future: ""I'm really looking forward to my first season in Formula One. My long association with the Sauber F1 Team has given me the chance to understand the complexity of Formula One. But I also realise, of course, that I still have a huge amount to learn. I will be working flat out to adapt to the whole F1 environment as quickly as possible and, if things open up during races, I want to make sure I'm ready to take full advantage.""
Test and reserve driver Frijns (21) spent last year competing in the World Series by Renault - and crowned his season with the championship title. ""I'm overjoyed that the Sauber F1 Team has given me this chance. I will do everything I can to support the team as effectively as possible and, at the same time, learn how things work in the professional world of Formula One,"" said the Dutch youngster.
The three drivers and the new Sauber C32-Ferrari are set to make a fine combination.
The F1 technical regulations have barely changed going into the 2013 season and yet the new Sauber C32-Ferrari is a very different proposition visually from its predecessor - thanks to a smooth, slightly downward-sloping nose section and, principally, much slimmer sidepods.
""The C31 was an extremely competitive car with many strengths,"" explained Matt Morris, the Sauber F1 Team's Chief Designer. Our aim was to further improve these strengths and eliminate its few weaknesses.
The sidepods of the C32 are notably slimmer than the Formula One norm up to now and are responsible for giving the new car a very distinctive look. ""The airflow in this area has a major influence over everything that happens at the rear of the car,"" said Morris, offering a glimpse into the team's thinking.
An extremely slim rear end was high up the engineers' list of priorities. One of the key aspects here is the arrangement of the radiators, which is very different from that in the C31. A look at the rear end of the new car reveals the engineers' rigorous approach to this area.
As before, the car's KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System), engine and gearbox are supplied by Ferrari. The KERS is based on last year's version, but its weight and packaging volume have been optimised. The rear axle is a totally new development. Although it still works according to the pullrod principle, its layout has been designed to better interact with the airflow around the rear of the car, while further improving the tyre management.
There was also potential for improvement in how the tyres are used in qualifying, as Morris explained: ""Our car looked after its tyres very well during races last year. However, we had problems now and again when it came to getting the maximum out of them in qualifying. We've looked at this phenomenon closely and made the required adjustments.""
Another high priority was reducing the car's overall weight, to allow a better distribution of the ballast, while retaining its structural requirements and mechanical setup flexibility. ""My colleagues have done an excellent job here, and we have even exceeded our original targets"", praised Morris.
Like last year, the Sauber F1 Team will use a basic version of the car for its rollout event and introduce a major update before the first race of the season.
""We have set ourselves lofty goals with the Sauber C32-Ferrari, and I'm confident that we'll be able to meet them. The C31 gave us a very good basis, to which we've made further improvements. Our aim is to line up for 2013 with a car that is competitive from the first race, but which also offers extensive potential for further development,"" summed up Morris."
Toro Rosso STR8 Ferrari,"Scuderia Toro Rosso today revealed its new car, the eighth in the team's history, in the Jerez de la Frontera pit lane, at an event organised by the team's Spanish sponsor, CEPSA. The wraps were pulled off the STR8 by our unchanged driver line-up of Daniel Ricciardo and Jean-Eric Vergne.
While the drivers are the same, the new car is the work of a changed and strengthened technical team. STR8 is the first car to be designed by a group led by chief designer Luca Furbatto, who joined the company just over a year ago, while the whole project is overseen by James Key, who has been the team's technical director since last September.
Pedro Miro (Chief Operating Officer, CEPSA): ""Last year at Jerez was the first time we were involved in a car presentation. Maybe for Franz and the team it was just another presentation like many others, but for us it represented our first full season in F1. For CEPSA, being in Formula 1, the highest level of motorsport, is an important link to the technical avant-garde and also helps promote our expansion on an international level and our spirit of striving to be among the best. Our close relationship with Toro Rosso means we have shared in their plans and projects ahead of the 2013 season and we have witnessed at first hand the great efforts made by everyone. We believe a great championship awaits for both CEPSA and Scuderia Toro Rosso.""
Franz Tost: ""Formula 1 is approaching a new era, specifically in 2014, and, at Toro Rosso, we have already made significant changes to our structure both in terms of manpower and facilities, to be ready for that. We believe the changes made will also help in the short term for this coming season and, combined with the fact that Daniel and Jean-Eric are more experienced, now that they have a season with us under their belts, we start winter testing in a mood of justified optimism.""
Daniel Ricciardo: ""The 2013 version of me is a more confident person and driver, with more self-belief than last year. I've always had the desire and determination to succeed and now I'm ready to reinforce that and let everyone see what I'm all about. I spent most of the winter Down Under and when I came back into the factory in Faenza, I could feel a very positive atmosphere with everyone excited about the new car. The target for us this year is very simple: to improve on last year.""
Jean-Eric Vergne: ""Going into this season is a completely different experience to this time last year, when I had to deal with a lot of unknowns. I had to learn the majority of tracks, understand so many details about Formula 1 and adapt to working with the team. This year, I will still be learning - you never stop in Formula 1 - but the basics are there and I will be able to focus on more important aspects of the job. In general, I sense a new philosophy within Toro Rosso: I wouldn't say people are working harder, but maybe they are going in a better direction."""
Williams FW35 Renault,"The Williams F1 Team launched its 2013 race car the FW35, at the Circuit de Catalunya in Spain today. The latest Williams is a culmination of more than 12 months' research and development by the team's technical departments in Grove and features improvements in several key areas over last year's race-winning FW34.
""Given the rule stability over the winter,"" says Williams Technical Director Mike Coughlan, ""I'm pleased with the gains that we've been able to make with this car. It's a better, more refined Formula One car than the FW34 and I think everyone involved in the project can feel proud of the work they've done.""
Despite being an evolution of 2012's car, more than 80 per cent of the FW35 is new. It has a new gearbox, new rear suspension, new radiators, a new floor, new exhausts, new bodywork, a new nose and a significant amount of weight has been saved as well.
With many new parts on the car, the team has carried out a lot of reliability work over the winter. The gearbox alone has already completed 3200kms on the dyno, a lot of which was conducted in the form of five straight Grand Prix weekends.
Today's unveiling of the FW35, however, with its drivers Pastor Maldonado and Valtteri Bottas is only the beginning. From here the car will continue to be developed throughout the year, beginning with an aerodynamic upgrade in time for the first race. By season's end it is expected that the FW35 will have made strong performance improvements and Coughlan is in no doubt over the main area of gain.
""The Coanda effect is going to be a big thing for us,"" Coughlan says. ""There's been no rule clarification concerning this area of the car, so we'll work closely with Renault to maximise the available gains. Use of the DRS is more restricted this year, so we'll take some resource away from that and focus on other areas.""
Frank Williams, Team Principal added: ""A group of talented people with good imagination and plenty of courage have been working together to build the Williams Renault FW35. We will have to wait until Australia to truly see what we have, but we believe it is step forward from last year's car which was also a very competitive vehicle. Pastor is a delightful character who is a massively determined racer, whilst Valtteri is quieter but still waters run deep and he is a highly gifted driver.
""Williams has been at the top many times over the last 30 years. It's the nature of the sport to have ups and downs, but when we are down we always fight our way back. I'm hoping that with the current team we have in place, our new FW35, the combined talent of Pastor, Valtteri and Susie, and the continued support from our partners; we will be in a position to challenge the very best.""
Pastor Maldonado: ""Starting my third season with Williams is important for both myself and the team. We've been working hard to develop the car and improve our performance. Last year we won a race and were competitive, but this season we must be even more competitive which I believe is possible. Consistency will be our aim to close the gap to the teams in front. There are a number of changes this season; I have a new Race Engineer and a new teammate in Valtteri, but there is a nice atmosphere right now as we are all competitive and know each other well. Being part of the Williams family is very special as a driver and I want to thank Frank for not only giving me the opportunity to drive for him, but also to deliver a win. My goal is to help take the team back to the top.""
Valtteri Bottas: ""It feels great to now be promoted to race driver with Williams this season. It's a big step and I'm really looking forward to it. I have been doing a lot of training, meeting with my engineers and working in the simulator in preparation; so I feel ready. We know we have improved our car from last season but I am looking forward to seeing how it compares on track. We have a busy test programme ahead but I'm really excited. The moment the start lights go out in Melbourne is a moment I have been building towards my whole career.""
Susie Wolff: ""I'm incredibly proud and excited to have increased my role with Williams this year. It's been a busy start for me as we awaited the arrival of the FW35 but I highly rate Mike Coughlan and his team and they have done a great job. Being the first to get behind the wheel of the FW35 at Idiada was a real honour. It was a special feeling to drive the FW35 out of the garage for the first time and successfully complete its first kilometres in front of many of the team who have put so much effort into the design and build."""
Caterham CT01 Renault,"After using the Lotus Racing and Team Lotus banners in 2010 and 2011 respectively, the Tony Fernandes run 1Malaysia Racing Team settled on Caterham F1 in 2012 after acquiring a majority stake in Caterham Cars in November of 2011. Further changes during the winter included a move to the Leafield Technical Centre where Arrows and Super Aguri had also been based. On the personnel there were initially fewer changes with designer Mike Gascoyne and drivers Jarno Trulli and Heiki Kovalainen remaining loyal to the team. After the first test of the season, however, Trulli was replaced by Vitaly Petrov.
Dubbed the CT01, Caterham's first Formula 1 car was an evolution of the Renault engined T128 used during the 2011 season. The most significant change was the adoption of a KERS hybrid system, supplied by Red Bull Racing, which also provided the seven-speed gearbox. A tweak in the aero-regulations, stipulating the maximum height of the nose, prompted Gascoyne to add a stepped nose to the car. Despite the new identity of the team, the green and yellow livery used during the previous seasons was once again carried over.
From the outset it was clear that the biggest rivals for the Caterham F1 team were going to be the other two 'new' teams Marussia and HRT. The objective was finishing 10th in the constructor's championship, which would be awarded with a piece of the prize fund. Despite being perceived as the best organised outfit of the three, Caterham struggled early on in the season. The coveted 10th place position was not guaranteed until the final race of the season when Vitaly Petrov recorded the team's best finish of 11th. That was enough to beat Marussia, who had managed no better than 12th."
Ferrari F2012,"The F2012 is the fifty eighth car built by Ferrari with the express purpose of taking part in the Formula 1 World Championship. It adopts a well established tradition of being named after its year of manufacture.
The project, which goes by the internal code number of 663, constitutes the Scuderia's interpretation of the technical and sporting regulations that apply this year: the main changes when compared to 2011 concern the height of the front section of the chassis, the position of the exhaust pipes and the mapping for the electronic engine management. Practically every area of the car has been fundamentally revised, starting with the suspension layout: both the front and rear feature pull-rods, aimed at favouring aerodynamic performance and lowering the centre of gravity. The front wing is derived from the one introduced on the 150° Italia in the final part of its racing life and has been evolved from there. Further evolutions are planned in this area for the opening races of the season. The nose has a step in it that is not aesthetically pleasing: with the requirement from the regulations to lower the front part, this was a way of raising the bottom part of the chassis as much as possible for aerodynamic reasons. The sides have been redesigned, through modifications to the side impact structures, the repositioning of the radiators and revisions to all aerodynamic elements. The lower part of the rear of the car is much narrower and more tapered, a feature achieved partly through a new gearbox casing and a relocation of some mechanical components. In recent years, the area of exhausts has been crucial in terms of car performance and much effort was expended on this front, based on changes to the regulations introduced this year. The rear wing is conceptually similar to the one used in 2011, but every detail of it has been revised and it is now more efficient. Naturally, it is still fitted with DRS (a drag reduction system,) which is operated hydraulically. The front and rear air intakes for the brakes have been redesigned and work was carried out in collaboration with Brembo to optimise the braking system.
The engine in the F2012 is an evolution of the one that powered last year's car, which is inevitable given that the technical regulations forbid any modification to internal components aimed at increasing performance. Furthermore, much effort has gone into improving its installation in the new chassis, so as not to penalise the aerodynamics of the car. Another area on which the Maranello engine specialists have been working is performance drop off, with the aim of maintaining the highest possible performance level throughout each engine's cycle of use, which has now reached an average life of three races. The electronic management of the engine has been revised based on the modifications to the rules regarding the use of exhaust gases, a task that has required a great deal of attention and many hours on the test bed. The kinetic energy recovery system maintains its low central location in the car - a choice also aimed at maximising safety - and has undergone an update directed mainly at reducing its weight and at improving the efficiency of some of its components. Several decades of technical collaboration with Shell has seen further progress on the fuel and lubricants front, revolving around improving performance in absolute terms and on durability over the life cycle of the engines, as well as reducing consumption. As usual, great attention has been paid to the electronics on the car, especially in terms of reducing weight and, obviously, reliability.
As always at Ferrari, a great deal of time has been devoted to the performance and optimisation of the materials used, right from the design stage of each of around six thousand components that make up the car. In part, this is done to ensure that all operations carried out at the race track are as efficient and effective as possible. Obviously, quality control remains a crucial aspect, as does the goal of reaching maximum levels of performance and reliability, while maintaining the highest possible safety standards.
With a reduction in the number of days available for track testing before the start of the Championship, which has dropped from fifteen to twelve, preparatory work on the test beds prior to the car's track debut, has taken on even more importance. The three test sessions - at Jerez de la Frontera and Barcelona - will serve to get a picture of the handling of the F2012 and to adapt it to the Pirelli tyres. Indeed, getting the most out of the tyres has been an area that has seen a lot of work both at the design stage and in how the activities at the track are to be managed. The car is due to undergo a very intensive development programme over the first part of the season, especially on the aerodynamic front."
Force India VJM05 Mercedes,"Sahara Force India unveiled its 2012 challenger today as Paul Di Resta and Nico Hulkenberg pulled the covers off the VJM05 at Silverstone. They were joined by reserve driver, Jules Bianchi, as the team's new car was presented for the first time.
The VJM05 is the second car to be created under the watch of Technical Director, Andrew Green, as the team seeks to build on its on its sixth place finish in the constructors' championship and take the fight to the teams that lie ahead.
""We have set our sights on challenging for fifth place,"" explained Team Principal and Managing Director, Dr. Vijay Mallya. ""To do so we will need to begin the new campaign by delivering the kind of form we showed in the second half of 2011. I believe this is a realistic goal and that we have the talent and determination to realise these ambitions.""
Chief Operating Officer, Otmar Szafnauer, echoed those sentiments as he praised the team's efforts to develop the VJM05: ""The new car has come together nicely over the winter. We don't know what our competitors have done, but we've made some gains over the winter and believe we're in reasonable shape. It's going to be difficult in the midfield, but our focus is on starting strongly and improving our position from last season.""
Summing up the approach to 2012, Andrew Green added: ""The car looks more refined; a lot racier and a lot more purposeful. You can start to see the aerodynamic concepts coming through now. It looks quite a bit different to the previous years, and so far the performance in the tunnel has been encouraging.""
The drivers were delighted to get their first glimpse of the new car and set out their hopes for the season ahead:
Paul Di Resta: ""Seeing the new car built and complete for the first time is always an exciting moment. It's when you realise that all the waiting is finally over and the season is beginning for real. I've had a good winter and I've recharged my batteries, but now I'm fully focussed on 2012 and looking forward to the start of testing. There's a really positive feeling in the team, good stability and hopefully we can pick up where we left off at the end of last year.""
Nico Hulkenberg: ""I saw the new car in the wind tunnel a few times and followed its progress during the winter. It looks aggressive and fast, but we won't know where we stand until we get out there and compete against the others. Preparations for the new season have been full-on with simulator sessions and lots of fitness training. I feel ready to get back to racing and I'm excited to find out what the new car feels like next week.""
Once again the Sahara Force India cars will be powered by the Mercedes engines with gearbox supplied by McLaren Applied Technologies. This will be the second season with the Mercedes KERS."
HRT F112 Cosworth,"All the hard work has finally paid off as the F112, the car with which HRT Formula 1 Team will compete this season, completed its first laps at the Circuit de Catalunya, in Barcelona.
Since the car passed the last crash test and was homologated, the team has carried out work shifts to cover 24 hours a day to make sure it could make it, for the first time in its history, to the first Grand Prix of the season having run previously.
The car was able to run after the team took advantage of one of the filming days available during the season.
The car made it to the circuit from Munich, Germany, just after one in the afternoon and the mechanics and engineers got straight down to business, working on relevant adjustments. It was a combined team effort, working against the clock, which saw its rewards four hours later when Narain Karthikeyan led the car out onto the track. Pedro de la Rosa, Dani Clos and Tonio Liuzzi were also present, as were Carlos Gracia, President of the Spanish Motorsports Federation and Salvador Servia, General Director of the Circuit de Catalunya.
The tests were carried out without any setbacks and the car carried out over ten laps. The team was able to check that the car functioned properly both from a mechanical and aerodynamic point of view as from a systems standpoint."
Lotus E20 Renault,"Lotus F1 Team unveiled its 2012 FIA Formula 1 World Championship challenger, the E20, on its website. Continuing with the evocative black and gold livery, the E20 heralds a new nomenclature to commemorate the twentieth chassis designed at the team's Enstone base through its Benetton, Renault F1 Team and Lotus Renault GP history.
The E20 incorporates ground-up redesigns and optimization of previous Enstone design philosophies. Most notably, the forward facing exhausts of 2011's R31 have been abandoned, both through regulation and necessity. The E20 also features a 'step' on its nose, this layout also being the result of a regulation change.
The front and rear suspension layouts have been substantially revised in the quest for ever- better aerodynamic efficiency whilst the front wing is a continuation of concepts used by the team during recent seasons.
The E20 has been designed utilizing the team's new 60% scale wind tunnel as well as its enhanced CFD facility, with both resources located on site at Enstone.
Rexona and CLEAR, two of the world's biggest personal care brands, are the latest partners to join the Lotus F1 Team. The brands, part of the Unilever portfolio, represent a perfect fit with the high levels of competition and performance associated with Formula 1 as a sport and more specifically with the Lotus F1 Team.
This season will see the 500th Grand Prix contested by Lotus F1 Team, including those contested through its previous incarnations of Toleman, Benetton, Renault F1 Team and Lotus Renault GP.
Toleman Motorsport entered Formula 1 in 1981 and started 57 Grands Prix, until in 1986 the team was renamed as Benetton. In this guise 260 races were contested, until in 2002 the team became Renault F1 Team. As Renault F1 Team, 159 Grands Prix were started, with the team becoming Lotus Renault GP for 2011, contesting a further 19 events. The current total of Grands Prix stands at 495.
Kimi Raikkonen, Romain Grosjean and Jérome D'Ambrosio comprise a strong driver line-up which includes a world champion in Kimi, and two success-hungry hungry young guns in Romain and Jérome. Kimi returns to Formula 1 eager to put the talents which have won him 18 Grands Prix and a World Championship to good effect in black and gold."
McLaren MP4-27 Mercedes,"The continuation of the double world-champion driver line-up, further consolidation of the championship-winning engineering team and a subtle, yet deep-reaching technical update of the car all underpin the world-class strength, experience and ambition that exists at Vodafone McLaren Mercedes ahead of the 2012 FIA Formula 1 World Championship.
The presentation of the MP4-27 at the McLaren Technology Centre showcased a natural evolution of last year's six-race-winning car and underlined the message that the new season is very much one of growth through strength and continuity. After finishing second in both the drivers' and constructors' championships in 2011, the aim for the new season is to fight for both world titles from the very start of this year's campaign.
While the all-new Vodafone McLaren Mercedes MP4-27 closely resembles last year's multiple race-winning car, the 2012 chassis has been substantially revised from the ground-up, with all major systems updated or re-designed for the new season. The most evident visual differences include more tightly waisted rear bodywork, developed to improve flow to the rear of the car, and a revised cooling system, which re-directs the gearbox oil-cooler. Last year's U-shaped sidepods have also been re-designed - a legacy of the FIA's new exhaust regulations that redefine the shape of the rear bodywork.
Maintaining the belief in the validity of strengthened continuity, Vodafone McLaren Mercedes is the only team in Formula 1 whose driver line-up consists of two world champions: Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton. Between them, they have scored 22 grand prix victories for Vodafone McLaren Mercedes and are the strongest and most consistent driver line-up in the sport. Maintaining the partnership into a third successive season was merely a formality.
On the technical front, the exemplary engineering trio Tim Goss (director of engineering), Paddy Lowe (technical director) and Neil Oatley (director of design and development programmes) once more remain at the forefront of the drawing office. For 2012, they will be joined by sporting director Sam Michael, whose arrival coincides with the re-organisation of the trackside personnel roster to ensure both growth and development within the group.
Away from the track, the team continues to develop, too: Vodafone McLaren Mercedes last year became the world's first carbon-neutral Formula 1 team, efficiently managing its carbon footprint and purchasing carbon credits to completely offset its emissions.
As well as continuing relationships of record-breaking length with partners such as Hugo Boss (31 years), TAG Heuer (27 years), Kenwood (22 years), ExxonMobil (18 years), Mercedes-Benz (18 years), Hilton (eight years) and Vodafone (six years), the new strategic partnership with GlaxoSmithKline continues to gather pace. Development and planning continue on the McLaren GSK Centre for Applied Performance, while GSK's Lucozade scientists are busy developing a groundbreaking cockpit drinks formula to hydrate the drivers during grands prix in 2012.
Finally, in a year when the world's spotlight will shine on London and the 2012 Olympics, McLaren proud that equipment and technology pioneered at the racetrack by Vodafone McLaren Mercedes and developed by McLaren Applied Technologies will be used by Team GB's athletes in their quest for Gold this summer."
Mercedes-Benz W03,"Mercedes-Benz marked two world premieres at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona, with the unveiling of the 2012 Silver Arrow, the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 W03, and the first public sneak preview of the brand-new Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG. The new high-performance roadster, which develops 537 PS while delivering weight savings of 125 kg and 30% improved fuel economy, was introduced by Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher.
The new Silver Arrow, the F1 W03, has undergone an intensive programme of simulation testing at the team's technical bases in Brackley and Brixworth. This was followed by a filming day limited to 100 kms at Silverstone on 16 February, and a private test day in Barcelona on 19 February, during which the car ran for 354 km. Michael and Nico shared driving duties on both days.
The new car concept is based on a largely stable set of technical regulations, which nevertheless include two significant changes: revision of the maximum bodywork height at the front of the car, which encouraged the distinctive stepped-nose design; and new restrictions concerning the positioning of the exhausts, designed to prevent the aerodynamic benefit gained from exhaust gases during 2011, the so-called 'blown diffuser'.
The F1 W03 project was begun in May 2011 and is the first full car produced by a technical team that was strengthened last year with recruitments at every level of the organisation. The new car, which is composed of some 4500 parts compared to 4300 parts in 2011, has nevertheless achieved a lower core weight than its predecessor, is better packaged and more efficient. All mandatory FIA crash tests had been successfully completed at the first attempt by the end of the first week of January 2012.
""The F1 W03 is a car that I believe, and hope, our team can be proud of, and which will deliver the on-track results that everybody has worked so hard to achieve,"" commented Team Principal Ross Brawn. ""Notwithstanding the distinctive nose design, which is certainly an acquired taste, the F1 W03 is an elegant interpretation of the current regulations, and a clear step forward over its predecessor in terms of detail design and sophistication. Last year, we produced a very bold car and, although its more radical elements didn't always deliver the results we had hoped for, the experience we gained has been invaluable to the design of the 2012 car. The F1 W03 is also a more integrated package, which reflects the ever-strengthening ties between our technical teams in Brackley and Brixworth, and demonstrates that our Silver Arrows works team is taking the next step forward in terms of on-track performance.""
Nico, who drove the first laps in the F1 W03 on 16 February in Silverstone, commented: ""We have had a good start to our 2012 testing programme, and it was a great feeling to drive the first laps in the new F1 W03. The car looks good, and is very nicely packaged under the bodywork - all the parts are in harmony, which reflects how well the different departments of our team are working together. From the beginning of our running, we have been able to focus on understanding the car and making good progress with our test programme. It will be very interesting to learn more about where we stand in the next few weeks.""
Michael, who will complete the first full day of official testing with the new car today in Barcelona, commented: ""I have done quite a few roll-outs and launches of new cars, but even after all these years, I must say it still feels special. Days like this are precious moments, as they are always filled with hope and anticipation. Already last week, when we were driving the F1 W03 for the very first time, it instantly gave us good feedback and sensations. Starting today, we will work intensively to make it a competitive runner. Obviously, we will only see over the next couple of weeks how big the step is that we have made, but I can say already that the guys and girls back in the factories at Brackley and Brixworth were brilliant in putting in so much effort, and we can only say a big thank you them. I know which reward they would like, and we will definitely try to deliver it. For my part, I am eager to fight again, looking forward to the new season, and I can't wait for it to begin.""
Norbert Haug, Vice President, Mercedes-Benz Motorsport, concluded: ""2012 will mark the third season for our Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows works team, which was introduced in January 2010, and our target is to take a step forward in on-track performance. A lot of work has been done throughout the last year, not just to design the new car but also to build a technical organisation that is capable of delivering to its full potential, with consistency. Our ultimate goal is to become regular race winners and championship contenders, and so to write another chapter of success in the story of the Silver Arrows which began 78 years ago. Our target this year is to take another step forward on that road."""
Red Bull Racing RB8 Renault,"Building on the Adrian Newey designed RB5, introduced in 2009, Red Bull Racing claimed the driver's and constructor's titles the following two seasons with the subsequent RB6 and RB7. Despite subtle rule changes, the Austrian owned team will field another evolution of the successful design.
The most significant change to the regulations is a new maximum nose height of 55 cm ahead of the bulkhead. High noses had become the norm to feed as much air under the chassis to generate downforce. To keep the negative effect to a minimum a very narrow nose was crafted, resulting in a bump at the chassis bulkhead.
While most teams use a similar, not particularly aesthetically pleasing solution, Newey's design was subtly different. On the RB8, the bump is equipped with a letterbox shaped air-intake. Officially the purpose of the slot is driver cooling but it immediately led to speculation about other possible purposes.
A more profound but not quite as obvious change is the ban of the 'blown diffuser', used very effectively by the recent Red Bulls. This relatively simple design used the high-speed exhaust fumes to generate additional downforce. With the system banned, a more conventional exhaust design could be used.
As in the previous seasons, the RB8 is powered by a Renault supplied V8 engine that also serves as a fully stressed member of the chassis. It is coupled to an in-house developed Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), which uses energy generating under braking to power a 60 kW electric motor for up to seven seconds per lap.
The new-for-2012 RB8 is the most significant change for the successful team as both drivers, reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber, were retained. The latter kicked off testing at Jerez early in February ahead of the season start in Australia in March."
Sauber C31 Ferrari,"The Sauber F1 Team launched its new car for the 2012 FIA Formula One World Championship. Drivers Kamui Kobayashi (25) and Sergio Pérez (22) unveil the Sauber C31-Ferrari at the Jerez de la Frontera circuit in Spain, where official Formula One pre-season testing got underway.
The Sauber F1 Team will enter its 20th season in the FIA Formula One World Championship spearheaded by an unchanged driver line-up. With Kamui Kobayashi, Sergio Pérez and reserve driver Esteban Gutiérrez piloting the new Sauber C31-Ferrari, the Swiss outfit will be looking to further improve in 2012. ""We're aiming to start the new season as strongly as we did in 2011, but then also to maintain this level of performance throughout the year,"" explains Team Principal Peter Sauber. ""Our goal is to finish regularly in the points so as to put ourselves in a significantly better position in the World Championship.""
Only three of their rivals on this year's grid have been in Formula One longer than Peter Sauber's team. After an excellent start to 2011, the team's form fell away mid-way through the season following the decision to cease development of a controversial technology. ""The Sauber C31-Ferrari boasts a large number of promising new developments, but in other areas it is a systematic further development of last year's car,"" says Sauber.
""We are looking forward to another season working with our young and talented drivers,"" adds the Team Principal. ""Kamui will be competing in his third full season in F1. Last year we asked him to take on leadership responsibilities within the team and he has grown into the role. With his rookie season behind him Sergio is now approaching his second season, which is often the most difficult in a driver's Formula One career. Both drivers have huge potential and will work with the same race engineers as in 2011 to continue developing that promise. Esteban will be competing full-time in GP2 in his second season in the category and has shown - most recently in the November test - that he could also step into the car for a Grand Prix, if required.""
The personable Kamui Kobayashi (25) became an instant favourite of Formula One fans on his arrival in the sport, not least with his daring but fair overtaking moves. ""2012 will be not only my third season in Formula One, but also my third with the same team,"" says the young Japanese. ""We've been through a lot together and can benefit from our shared experiences. In my first year with the team we had a bad start but a good second half to the season. The second year was the exact reverse. In our third year together we should be a reliable bet to finish consistently in the points. I'm really looking forward to the new season with the Sauber F1 Team.""
In 2012 Sergio Pérez (22) is setting out to put the lessons from a turbulent but impressive rookie season in 2011 into practice. ""My first year in Formula One felt like three years, there were so many new things to take in,"" admits the Mexican. ""But now I feel like I've arrived in Formula One and I'm determined to take a step up in 2012 and achieve better results for the team on a regular basis.""
20-year-old Esteban Gutiérrez will be focusing on the races in the GP2 Series. ""At the same time,"" says the team's other Mexican driver, ""I'm looking forward to working more with the Sauber F1 Team. I'm learning a lot by being able to experience and analyse the professionalism and intensity of the team's work from the inside. It's good preparation for me.""
Summarising all the efforts put into developing the new Sauber C31-Ferrari, Chief Designer Matt Morris says: ""The C31 is revolutionary where we had fresh ideas, particularly at the rear of the car, and it is an evolution where we knew we could carry over certain approaches. We had to improve on the weaknesses we identified on the C30, but at the same time we wanted to maintain its strengths.""
The engineers opted again to go with a high chassis design. However, according to the new 2012 regulations, the nose cone needs to be lower, which is a safety requirement. As a result, the nose cone has quite a different shape to how it was in the past. The chassis itself shows absolute minimum cross sections all the way to the cockpit.
By an overall tidier design, the front suspension has been optimised for integration with the chassis and the upright. Otherwise it's a traditional layout with a pushrod and a high-level wishbone.
Packaging was further optimised under the side pods in order to open up more aerodynamic development scope in that area. The cooling layout is based around a similar philosophy to the C30, because that proved to be effective. It helps to get the volume of the coolers forward and allows the design of very compact rear bodywork.
A familiar element of the car is the Ferrari engine, onto which an all-new carbon transmission is bolted - also supplied by Ferrari. The longitudinally mounted transmission is a very tidy, neat unit. The entire rear of the car is much more tightly packaged, helped by the gearbox design, and in addition the engineers have gone in some new directions around the floor at the back of the car. The exhaust tailpipe positions are regulated in 2012, which has had a further effect on how the bodywork design has been set out.
The rear suspension is now a pullrod design. It shows a long pullrod towards the front of the gearbox and wide angled wishbones. This design allows improved packaging of the rear spring and damper elements. Despite the change from pushrod to pullrod, in terms of kinematics the engineers maintained a similar direction to the one they went in for the C30.
Finally, Morris casts a glance at the next steps after the roll-out of the Sauber C31-Ferrari: ""The current plan is to launch a fairly basic roll-out version of the car, which was defined quite some time ago. We will then be testing development parts during the upcoming weeks with a late upgrade for the first race on 18th March in Australia. Therefore the car will look quite different in Melbourne compared to the roll-out car."""
Toro Rosso STR7 Ferrari,"Running as Scuderia Toro Rosso and under the umbrella of Red Bull Racing for the seventh season, it was all change at the Italian team for 2012. Longterm drivers Sébastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersari were replaced by talented rookies Daniel Ricciardo and Jean-Eric Vergne. They were both promoted to the race seats not in search of immediate success but to groom for a potential future at Red Bull Racing, as such justifying the existing of the Toro Rosso team.
Ricciardo and Vergne were tasked to drive the STR7, which was the third car developed by the team completely independently from Red Bull Racing. With relatively few rule changes between the 2011 and 2012 season, it was only natural for the STR7 to be a development of the STR6, which was also designed by the Giorgio Ascanelli led team. Built around a conventional carbon fibre monocoque, it boasted push-rod actuated springs and dampers at the front and pull-rods at the rear for aerodynamic efficiency. The naturally aspirated V8 engine was supplied by long-term partner Ferrari.
The season started off well with Ricciardo and Vergne scoring points in the opening two rounds of the World Championship. After the promising start, things went downhill and it took until the Belgium Grand Prix in August before more points were scored, with Ricciardo and Vergne finishing ninth and eighth respectively. Although more points were scored in the final races of the season, resulting in a total of 26, Scuderia Toro Rosso could do no better than ninth in the championship, beating only the three 'new' teams, who scored no points at all.
As a consequence of the poor results, Ascanelli was replaced by James Key halfway through the season. The resulting STR8 only managed to perform marginally better, scoring 33 points in 2013, which was good for eighth in the championship. Toro Rosso did live up to its original purpose as Daniel Ricciardo was signed to drive for Red Bull Racing in 2014, replacing his compatriot Mark Webber."
Williams FW34 Renault,"The Williams F1 Team unveiled its 2012 FIA Formula One World Championship season entry, the Williams Renault FW34, at the Jerez circuit in Spain. This year marks the team's 35th year competing in the sport which it will do with a revitalised line-up.
The mechanical and aerodynamic design and development direction of the FW34 has been driven by a new technical leadership. Guided by Technical Director Mike Coughlan, this year's car takes on a fresh design philosophy. Revised FIA technical regulations - of which the most significant are bans on exhaust blowing and exotic engine mapping and a drop in nose height, the FW34 carries fewer than five per cent of the parts from last year's FW33.
The team will also race with a new driver pairing in 2012 as Bruno Senna partners Pastor Maldonado after a considered winter evaluation process. Finn Valtteri Bottas completes the driver line up as Official Reserve Driver, taking part in most of the season's Friday practice sessions.
Williams rejoins Renault for its engine partnership. Williams and Renault enjoyed a nine-year association between 1989 and 1997 which produced four Drivers' and five Constructors' titles and 63 race wins. The French manufacturer's RS27 V8 power unit is renowned for its drivability, flexibility and durability and will provide the FW34 with a strong performance platform for the forthcoming season.
Powering the team's efforts in this year's championship will be a broad partner group. Existing partners, including Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), Venezuelan Tourism, Randstad, Thomson Reuters, Ridge Solutions, Hatch and McGregor will be joined by new additions confirmed today. Gillette, Embratel, Head & Shoulders, OGX and MRV, together with Michael Johnson Performance announced in January, will all be supporting the team as it works towards a competitive season of Formula One motor racing."
Ferrari F150th Italia,"The F150 is the fifty-seventh single-seater built by Ferrari specifically to compete in the Formula 1 World Championship. The Maranello marque chose the name as a tribute and celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Unification of Italy.
The project, which goes by the internal code name of 662, represents the Scuderia's interpretation of the technical and sporting regulations that apply this year. Various factors influenced the design of the car, especially on the aerodynamic front, to the extent that the F150 can be seen as severing ties with the recent past. The innovative aspects are in part dictated by changes to the regulations and partly down to original thinking from our designers. As far as the rule changes from 2010 are concerned, the double diffuser and the blown rear wing are banned, as is the use of apertures in the front part of the floor, while the use of an hydraulically controlled adjustable rear wing has been introduced. After an unofficial agreement saw its use banned for 2010, KERS is back this year, thanks partly to the increase in the car's minimum weight and stricter controls on weight distribution figures. The Scuderia has decided to incorporate this technology on the F150 and this has had a significant impact on the design, also taking into account that the dimensions of the fuel cell are very different to what they were in 2009. Also significant are changes dictated by the introduction of stricter safety requirements in terms of crash-tests, cockpit area protection and wheel-retaining cables for use in accidents.
At first glance, the front part of the F150 monocoque appears to be higher than that of the F10. The openings for the side air intakes are reduced in size, while the layout of the dynamic one above the driver's head has been modified. The rear suspension features a new design, while that at the front has been modified, following changes to the front part of the chassis. The exhaust system layout is similar to that adopted for the second half of last season and the cooling system has had to take into account the return of KERS and the new air exit ducts. The braking system has been completely redesigned in collaboration with Brembo.
However, the aerodynamic package sported by the car at the presentation is very different to the one which will be seen for the first race in Bahrain: for the early stages of testing, the decision was taken to concentrate on development aspects linked to the mechanical components and on developing an understanding of the Pirelli tyres, while continuing to push on the development of aerodynamic performance in the wind tunnel. Indeed, the tyres will be another significant new element this season: after a thirteen year relationship with Bridgestone, this year it is Pirelli who take up the baton as sole supplier to Formula 1 for the next three years and thus provide the tyres for the cars from Maranello. Given that the teams have so far only managed two days of testing with the new tyres back in November, clearly the fifteen days of testing prior to the start of the season will be very important when it comes to adapting the handling of the car to the tyres.
As the freeze on engine performance development is still ongoing, there have been no actual modifications to the 056 engine, but that does not mean Ferrari's engine specialists have been idle. Work has gone into improving reliability, working especially on the pneumatic front, as well as on reducing costs. Furthermore, the reintroduction of KERS has led to a substantial change in the architecture of the front end of the engine, with modifications to the drive shaft system of the KERS itself and the crankshaft and this has led to changes to the cooling and lubrication systems. The kinetic energy recovery system, designed by Ferrari, has been produced in conjunction with MTS and Magneti Marelli and was fine tuned based on experience acquired in 2009, with the aim of reducing its size and weight, while maintaining, in accordance with the regulations, the maximum useable power and its usage cycle over one lap. This is another area where great attention has been paid to cost reduction, both in terms of its development and the way it is run, so as to make the system equally viable for our customer teams, Sauber and Toro Rosso. The positioning of the KERS within the fuel cell was a further impetus to look at solutions aimed at reducing fuel consumption: in this area, the contribution from a key partner in the form of Shell was vital and will continue to be so throughout the season.
The number of testing days available to the teams remains the same, with 15 prior to the start of the season, therefore preparatory work on the test beds, prior to taking to the track has been ever more important, both on the chassis side and for areas such as the gearbox, engine and KERS.
As is always the case at Ferrari, great attention has been paid to the performance and optimisation of all materials used, in the design stages and when going through quality control, striving to maximise performance levels and reliability, while delivering the highest possible safety standards."
Force India VJM04 Mercedes,"The Force India VJM04 is the first car created by the team under its new technical director Andrew Green, who exactly 20 years ago was one of the men behind the original Jordan 191.
Green and rest of the Silverstone-based team faced major challenges created by the changes in the 2011 FIA Technical Regulations, with a cut in downforce and the movable rear wing chief among them. In addition Pirelli has become the new tyre supplier, and the teams have agreed to allow the use of KERS again. The result is a car that is very different from its predecessor.
'Everything is different, but visually a lot of it is subtle,' says Green, who re-joined the team in July 2010. 'The most obvious visual change is that we've gone away from a conventional roll-hoop to a blade. This gives us a small packaging improvement compared to a more conventional style. The engine cover is different, in-line with the abolition of the F-duct system. But there are a lot of differences under the skin that people won't necessarily notice.'
The ban on double diffusers and other changes in the rules created a drastic cut in downforce at the rear of the car. Getting it back has been one of the major challenges of the winter.
'We've recovered a lot of the aerodynamic performance, we believe. We still have a little bit to go, but we are still in the process of the realignment after the end of last season, because it does take a long time to move aerodynamically from one position to another. The movable wing is a whole new game, and we'll be trying to exploit its performance to the max.
'We've also put in a lot of work trying to maximise the potential performance of the new Pirelli tyre compounds. To this end we've recruited a new senior tyre engineer, Jun Matsusaki, to guide us through the development process. The test we recently conducted in Valencia was a good learning exercise.
'Exhaust management will also be a big area of development this year. There will be an upgrade for the first race, so there are some changes that will come into effect at the Bahrain test. Further down the line there are some big updates for the front of the car coming in for the first European race.'
Significantly the team has done far more than simply address the new rules. It has also gone back to basics by taking a close look at the fundamentals of last year's package, and attempted to address key areas of concern.
'Towards the end of last season there was a drop-off in our relative performance,' says Green. 'In theory we were adding performance to the car, but it wasn't getting translated to the track. We decided to have a very close look at what was happening on the car, and what could be causing this. The bottom line is we didn't extract the most from the blown diffuser, thus over the winter we've taken a reasonable philosophy chance on the aerodynamics of the car in order to try and prevent the sort of drop-off in performance that we saw at the end of last year.'
In addition the team has focussed on improving its performance in high downforce spec.
'Looking back over the years the cars we have produced here have always struggled at the high downforce tracks - they always been 'slippery' cars. We've identified a problem, and now we have to fix it, and it means that potentially there's another strategic aero change coming as well.'
Underlining the team's renewed focus on aerodynamic development, there will extra emphasis on gathering data on the Fridays of race weekends.
'We are going to be using the real car at the track as a validation tool for the aerodynamics, which is something that we haven't done effectively before. There's a lot more focus on what's actually happening on the car aerodynamically. To measure it at the fidelity that we need to measure it at is a huge task.
'We understand how important it is, and we're in that game now as well. That will start to feed back into the aerodynamic development of the car. When we get positive results it backs up our development tools, and when we don't, we'll investigate why. Fridays will be a lot more about understanding the car we have as well as understanding the track at the time and the tyres you're running.'
The change requires more accurate sensors and different procedures for gathering data, better analysis tools, and dedicated people at the trackside focussing on the aerodynamic performance.
Force India is not entirely new to KERS. The 2009 car was designed to utilise the Mercedes system and the team ran it in testing, although it was never raced.
'The Mercedes KERS system looks very strong, and we're really happy with it. We've done a lot of running in the simulator, so the drivers are well up to speed with how to use it. We're well developed with what we have to do for harvesting and deployment. It's smaller and lighter than in 2009, and packaging required very few vehicle compromises.'
Summing up, Green says the intention is to build momentum over the course of the year as developments come on stream, and the aero work pays dividends.
'There are some big developments in the pipeline, probably bigger than this team has seen for quite a while. I think we're looking for a much stronger finish to the season, and we do recognise the fact that there's an Indian GP on the calendar, and we are an Indian team. The plan is to be putting stronger performance on the car through the year that will lift us up the ranks.'"
HRT F111 Cosworth,"Hispania Racing is shaping up the F111, the new Spanish Team's car, which will be hitting the tracks of the 2011 F1 season.
Hispania Racing is pleased to show the pictures of the new car developed by its own group of engineers and designers under the technical leadership of Geoff Willis and Chief Designer Paul White.
Jose Ramon Carabante, Hispania Racing President, stated: ""We feel really proud of the car our drivers will run this forthcoming season. Despite a challenging first year, we managed to finish on the eleventh position in the World Constructors Championship. Now, we are very pleased to introduce the first spec of the F111, which means a huge design-effort from our side. This is only a first step as we are planning several updates during the season.""
Colin Kolles, Team Principal of Hispania Racing, ""The F111 represents a significant step forward for Hispania Racing. We have made a big improvement for starting our second season in Formula 1 and what you see in our new car confirms Hispania Racing's commitment to F1."" Colin Kolles also reveals that ""the F111 will incorporate the adjustable rear wing.""
Daniel Simon who was responsible for the livery of the car, has perfectly expressed the combination of his personal ideas and those of Hispania Racing.
Colin Kolles: ""Daniel has created a wonderfully confident look for our new car which really captures the effort the whole team has put into developing the F111. The car design and the graphic design perfectly complement one another and mark the real beginnings of our ambitions.""
Daniel is today one of the most imaginative and adventurous designers in both Hollywood and the motor industry. Although he and his label Cosmic Motor live mostly in the future, he also has a strong passion for motor racings bold iconic liveries from the past, and he has drawn inspiration of them in creating Hispania Racing's new livery. ""I miss fearless visual statements and large beautiful numbers on today's racing cars.""
That distinct Cosmic Motors look brings together racing spirit and commercial reality, blending the dual requirements in a seamless, but attractive manner, which reflects the motivated vibe of the Hispania Racing team as it enters its second Formula 1 season.
Working within the defined Hispania Racing shape was enjoyable for Daniel, ""Playing with the restrictions of what you can do to a complex F1 body is fun. There are many don'ts, but I found a way to lay courageous racing essence on the car."""
McLaren MP4-26 Mercedes,"With the two most recent world champions in their ranks, McLaren were understandably optimistic going into the 2010 season. The new-for-the-year MP4-25 also featured a trick aerodynamic system that allowed the driver to 'stall' the rear wing on the straights, giving the McLaren a top-speed advantage. Unfortunately Red Bull Racing lined up with an aerodynamically even more advanced machine. Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button nevertheless managed to win five Grands Prix between them and McLaren finished the year second in the constructor's table.
Subtle changes to the regulations encouraged the British team to develop a drastically different car for 2011. The most signification revision was the ban of the 'double diffuser', which generated a significant amount of downforce on the 2010 car. Additional changes included the return of the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) hybrid drive and a switch to Pirelli rubber from long-time exclusive supplier Bridgestone. All new for 2011 was the Drag Reduction System (DRS) that allows drivers to open part of the rear wing when chasing another car on certain parts of the track to make passes a little easier.
Efficiency was the key word in McLaren's design brief for 2011, which resulted in a very distinct L-shaped sidepods. Somewhat reminiscent of the design used on the 1995 Benetton, this solution allows air to flow more efficiently to the rear end of the car. For that same reason, the Neil Oatley led design team followed Red Bull Racing and switched to a pull-rod rear suspension from the more conventional push-rod layout. Another significant change to the mechanical package was the addition of the components needed to make the KERS work. Charged by the rear axle, the system consists of a battery pack to store the energy and a 60 kW electric motor bolted to the gearbox."
Mercedes-Benz W02,"The debut of the MGP W02, the new Silver Arrow for the 2011 Formula One World Championship, took place this morning at the Valencia Circuit in Spain with the new challenger unveiled in front of the MERCEDES GP Petronas team garage by Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher.
The result of twelve months intense design and development work, the MGP W02 is the second Silver Arrows car to be launched by MERCEDES GP Petronas since the team became the first Mercedes-Benz works outfit since 1955.
The car's livery is an evolution from its predecessor with a striking high-gloss airbrush effect highlighting the shape of the car. The interaction between the Silver Arrows heritage and the green shading representing the team's title partner Petronas evokes memories of the first Silver Arrow car of 1934 with a modern touch added by 3D partner logos.
The technical specification of the MGP W02 includes the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery) system which returns to the sport after a one-year absence. The Mercedes KERS system was the first to win a Grand Prix during the 2009 season when KERS made its debut in Formula One. Also new on the car for this season is the adjustable rear wing, operated by the driver to aid overtaking, and Pirelli tyres as the Italian manufacturer becomes the sport's official tyre supplier.
The team's driver line-up remains unchanged with seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg, who achieved the team's three podiums in 2010, forming one of the most exciting and talented pairings on the grid.
""Finally the waiting is over and things get started. For us drivers, the break every year is hard to take because the gap between the last race and the first time out on track seems to be never-ending. Even if I have been involved and updated all winter on the developments, and even if I know the improvements are significant, it is still different to see the new car literally for the first time in front of you. You automatically build up this nice pre-start tension. I very much look forward to the new season. We have said it several times already but again, we are really to building up something big together. I am very confident that this season we will be standing on the podium much more regularly; ideally in the middle!""
""It is always a very exciting time of year to drive the new car for the first time and feel how it performs out on track. This year we have the added challenge of not having an immediate reference due to the change in tyre manufacturer to the new Pirelli tyres, which felt good during our first try-out at the Abu Dhabi test last year. I am very much looking forward to having a much stronger season than last year and as always, our targets are aggressive. We want to be competing at the front and challenging for race wins. Everyone at our factories in Brackley and Brixworth has worked extremely hard on the new Silver Arrow and we are all looking forward to seeing how it performs.""
""It is always a thrill to see a new car ready to take the track for the first time and this year is no exception. After our first year as the Mercedes-Benz works team, we are now seeing the benefits of our chassis group and our engine group working well together. With a good technical structure and a strengthened race engineering organisation, both at the factory and the race track, I am confident that we have done and will continue to do a better job this year in all key areas.
""The concept development for the MGP W02 started early and we have set challenging targets for the design, combined with a robust plan to ensure that the pace of development can continue throughout the long 2011 season. We have two excellent drivers in Michael and Nico, both of whom capable of winning races in a good car, and we look forward to seeing them push each other and the development of the new Silver Arrow during the season. We want to be setting the standard right from the start but if we are not, we will respond very strongly to get ourselves into the game. Everyone is excitedly waiting to see what the new season will reveal.""
""The new Silver Arrow for the 2011 season has little in common with its immediate predecessor. Our chassis engineers have taken a fairly ruthless approach and were determined to shave off every superfluous gram and millimetre. What emerged from this process is a compact and exquisitely shaped vehicle that introduces a host of sophisticated solutions and truly reflects the enormous dedication of its constructors. We have given it a brand new coat of paint, and we aim to see a smile on the faces of our hard-working drivers and team members that is as bright as our new silver livery.
""Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher are top drivers who can win races for us, provided we build them the right car. At the same time, our team, like all the other teams, has to deal with complex new tasks. The new generation of tyres from Pirelli, and the extent to which the cars and drivers adapt to them, will play a vital role in deciding wins and defeats.
""The rear wing flap, which can be adjusted under specified conditions, will boost top speed and facilitate overtaking which should open up a new and interesting chapter for Formula One. And there is the return of KERS following a one-year absence at the end of the 2009 season when our Mercedes system recorded a historic first race win. This will play a massive role amongst all of the performance-related components, both for the additional power and for the strategic options it makes available. As in 2009, it is our ambition that Mercedes-Benz builds and runs the best hybrid system and that all three teams which use it benefit significantly from this.
""After I have spoken at length here on the many new issues, our target can be described in one short sentence: The new Silver Arrow should not only look first class, but should also be developed to be at the top step-by-step."""
Red Bull Racing RB7 Renault,"Considering the raw pace of the RB6, it took Red Bull Racing much longer to secure both titles in 2010 than seemed strictly necessary. The Adrian Newey designed machine was easily the quickest from the first race and throughout the year the rivals worked overtime to incorporate some of the features that they believed made the RB6 so fast. Reliability issues hampered the car until for much of the season but they were ironed out when it mattered most.
Several major rule changes ahead of the 2011 season meant Newey and his team once again had their work cut out for them. One of the key elements of the RB6's success was the intricate double diffuser, further optimised by routing the high speed exhaust gasses over it. The new rules have eliminated the loophole that had original allowed for these 'double diffusers'. Other major changes include the return of the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System), a moveable rear wing to help with overtaking and a switch to Pirelli rubber.
Just like the RB6 had been an evolution of the RB5 used in 2009, the new RB7 is once again an evolution of the previous year's design. The new-for-2011 rules have resulted in some visual changes like the much simpler diffuser and the shorter fin on the engine cover. Other than that the family lineage is still very clear. The unconventional rear pull-rod is also again part of the package and two years after it appeared on the RB5, several other teams have followed Newey's example for 2011.
Despite talks with Mercedes-Benz, Red Bull Racing has maintained its engine supply deal with Renault. Because of the freeze in engine design, the 2011 specification of the 'RS27' V8 features no major changes. That means it is still down on power compared to the Ferrari and Mercedes engines. It is however much more tractable out of low speed corners, which particularly suits the Red Bull design.
In 2010 the team opted to sit out the first official test session to develop the car further. Despite the very long season, the RB7 was ready to join its rivals at the very first opportunity. Like its predecessor, the new Red Bull was quick straight out of the box. The key word during testing was 'exhausts' and exactly where they were pointing. On the RB7 they were initially simply sticking out of the bodywork just above the floor. The final design, however, featured slightly longer pipes, very specifically aimed at the diffuser to create maximum downforce.
As with all of Newey's creations, aerodynamic efficiency was the primary objective for the RB7 design. How little he was prepared to compromise was revealed after the season opening Australian Grand Prix. Instead of adjusting his design, he demanded the KERS bits (battery, motor and ancillaries) to be modified to fit the car. This has resulted in some cooling related reliability issues, which forced the team to remove the system altogether after the first day of practice.
Topping two of the three practice sessions with quite a margin, the RB7 immediately made its mark. In qualifying 2010 world champion, Sebastian Vettel, was simply unstoppable. He was nearly eight tenths of a second faster than his closest rival, even though he did not have the benefit of the 80 bhp KERS system. He continued that form in the race and scored that all important victory in the season opener. Team-mate Mark Webber was off the pace, which was most likely down a problem with the chassis.
Whereas reliability issues hampered Vettel and Red Bull's 2010 campaign early, the defending champions have now hit the ground running. The rivals clearly have their work cut out for them if they want to bridge the impressive gap."
Renault R31,"The world's media got their first glimpse of Lotus Renault GP's 2011 challenger this afternoon as the R31 was presented in the pit lane of the Circuit de la Comunitat Valenciana Ricardo Tormo.
Robert and Vitaly joined Gerard Lopez (Chairman of LRGP) and Eric Boullier (Team Principal and Managing Director) to pull back the covers and present the car the team hopes will continue the squad's push towards the front of the grid.
""For Genii Capital and Lotus Renault GP, the 2011 season will be the one in which we achieve our aims,"" said Gerard Lopez. ""We now have 100% ownership of the team, and we're tackling the coming championship with the intention of continuing to do things our way - but always with humility. I would like to welcome Lotus Cars, a new ambitious title sponsor with us for the long term. Renault and Total have also chosen to accompany us again in this adventure and we thank them for their valuable contribution. Our aim for 2011 is to continue our march towards the front of the grid, seize the slightest opportunity and do better than last season in both the drivers' and constructors' championships. We feel we are well prepared for the challenge ahead.""
Eric Boullier echoed those sentiments and paid tribute to the enormous effort back at the team's base in Enstone: ""All the hard work over the winter has been focused on delivering a big improvement for 2011. The result is a car with more than 92% new parts compared to the R30. But technical innovation isn't the only key to performance. Since last year, we have reviewed all our internal processes and our overall efficiency has now improved by 15%. That means we should be more competitive than last year, on the track and at the factory.""
Technical Director, James Allison, explained how the team approached the design of the R31: ""Words like 'aggressive' and 'innovative' are very much in vogue in Formula 1 at the moment, but where the R31 is concerned we feel those adjectives are appropriate. It's true to say that the car has been designed in an ambitious manner and a quick glance at the layout will confirm that its entire concept differs considerably, not just from last year's car, but from any car this team has ever produced.""
Both Robert and Vitaly were enthusiastic as they got acquainted with their new car and eager for the season to get underway.
""After a long winter break you always feel ready to jump back in the car,"" explained Robert. ""At the moment it's difficult to know just how competitive our package will be, but the engineers have decided to go for an innovative design, which is good.""
Vitaly added: ""It feels exciting to be starting my second year of Formula 1 and I can't wait to try this beautiful car for the first time tomorrow. Now that I have a year of F1 experience behind me, I feel more confident and ready to deliver. I'm determined to do well and fight hard for this team.""
The team's new third drivers were presented as well, with Bruno Senna and Romain Grosjean adding further strength to the team's driver line-up. The team's reserve drivers (and members of the LRGP Academy) were confirmed as Jan Charouz, Ho-Pin Tung and Fairuz Fauzy (who was unable to attend the launch due to his GP2 Series commitments).
The team also welcomes two important new partners in SunCore and Sibur, while Genii Capital promotes its Business Exchange platform through more significant branding on the car."
Sauber C30 Ferrari,"The day before the start of the official Formula One testing, the Sauber F1 Team presented the Sauber C30-Ferrari at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Cheste near Valencia, Spain.
Two thousand and eleven sees the Sauber F1 Team embark on its 19th Formula One season. Leaving behind the upheavals of 2010 that followed the metamorphosis from a works to a private team, the aim is to present itself in 2011 with renewed stability.
Team Principal Peter Sauber outlines the targets: ""We want to finish in the points regularly and clearly improve our position in the FIA Formula One Constructors' World Championship."" He goes on to elaborate: ""Two thousand and ten marked the 41st year of our company history and one of the most difficult. But we managed to overcome these difficulties in the second half of the season. We implemented some well-considered structural changes. The appointment of James Key as Technical Director already bore fruit last season, and he is now in charge of development of the Sauber C30-Ferrari. At the same time, we have managed to secure our business foundation for the 2011 season. In these economically straitened times that is something we can be proud of too.""
As for the drivers, the team looks forward with keen anticipation to continuing to work with Kamui Kobayashi, and with eager curiosity to Sergio Pérez. The Japanese driver, who turns 25 in September 2011, is embarking on his second full Formula One season. In 2010 he drew attention to himself with his high speed on track, stunning overtaking manoeuvres and reliable implementation of race strategies. He made very few mistakes and earned 32 of the team's 44 World Championship points. ""My rookie season is now behind me,"" says Kobayashi. ""I learned a lot, gained a lot of self-confidence, and my target for 2011 is not to make any mistakes.""
The team's new rookie is Sergio Pérez. He hails from Mexico and celebrated his 21st birthday in January 2011. He took his first Formula One test with Sauber in Abu Dhabi in November 2010, having finished as runner-up in the GP2 Championship. ""I'm aware how challenging Formula One is from both a driver's point of view and technically,"" says Pérez. ""I've got a lot to learn, and in Kamui I have an excellent yardstick. My personal goal is to make steady progress. The support I'm getting back in my home country is huge, and I don't want to disappoint anyone over there either.""
Pérez isn't the only Mexican in the Sauber F1 Team: Esteban Gutièrrez is standing by as test and reserve driver. Born in August 1991, he is a good one-and-a-half years younger than his compatriot. Sauber had already taken Gutièrrez under its wing in 2010 as an affiliated driver. The youngest member of the team swept up a commanding GP3 Championship win last year and will be competing in GP2 in 2011. ""I've still got a long way to go,"" Gutièrrez is only too aware, ""but ever since the two days of testing with Sauber, at the end of 2009 and the end of 2010, Formula One has been my goal.""
The aim is for the Sauber C30-Ferrari not just to prove more reliable than its predecessor; there were a number of other weaknesses to be banished as well. One of the overriding targets is to improve aerodynamic efficiency, low-speed cornering, mechanical grip and to gain more flexibility in suspension tuning.
The new technical regulations certainly presented the engineers with a tricky assignment, since the ban on double diffusers fundamentally alters the car's aerodynamic concept. Another tough challenge was the switch to Pirelli tyres, which meant the engineers had to make decisions during the concept phase before the teams had a chance to test the tyres out on track. Further changes stipulate a ban on the F-duct and the adjustable front wing. Instead, the rear wing may now be adjusted by the driver, and the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) is once again available to run.
The striking visual features of the Sauber C30 are a raised front, slender waist, compact rear, new rollhoop and downward-sloping engine cover. Propelling the car as before is the Ferrari 056 engine, while power delivery is courtesy of a new Ferrari transmission. The KERS also comes from the Maranello factory.
Technical Director, James Key, summarises: ""In order to take a step forward in 2011, we were already systematically tackling the C29's weaknesses over the last season - and we've made progress. The insights we gleaned were taken into account when the concept for the new C30 was being drawn up. Since some of the changes decreed by the regulations - particularly regarding the tyres - can only be analysed out on track, it was important for us to build, firstly, a fundamentally predictable car and, secondly, one that would provide sufficient flexibility to respond to ongoing findings at the track and during further development stages.""
One thing is clear: the status of the car at the rollout in Valencia on 31st January 2011 is only the start. As part of the development programme, the team will be fitting the C30 with a new aerodynamic package before the curtain raiser in Bahrain.
New on the car are the logos of Telmex, Claro and Telcel - all three brands belong to America Movil, the Central and Latin American telecommunication group. Interproteccion is an insurance group from Mexico. Also a new partner from Mexico is the Tequila brand Jose Cuervo. Familiar, as they have appeared on the team's cars for a long time, are the Swiss names of sport watch manufacturer Certina and automotive group Emil Frey AG. Also known from last season is the logo of Mad-Croc (Energy Gum, Chews and Drinks)."
Team Lotus T128 Renault,"The Team Lotus 2011 challenger T128 was launched on Monday 31st January exclusively in Team Lotus Notes. The special launch edition of the team's magazine has a number of first-see images of the 2011 car and insights from key players within Team Lotus into the design and build process of the new car, including people from the Aero, R&D and Vehicle Dynamics, Design and Senior Management Teams.
Marianne Hinson, Head of Aerodynamics: ""In aero we started thinking about the new car around Spring last year, a bit before any of the other departments. The start of the process is a really fun period, when you're looking through the new rules, thrashing out ideas and trying to find loopholes.""
Lewis Butler, Chief Designer: ""The biggest design challenge was trying to package everything a bit smaller. We were trying to get that area around the driver really tight so the aerodynamicists were happy with it.""
Elliot Dason-Barber, Head of R&D and Vehicle Dynamics: ""We're definitely going to take a step forward with this car. Quite how much we'll close the gap to the teams in front of us we'll see, but my hope is we'll be competing with the teams that were a second or two ahead of us last season.""
Keith Saunt, Chief Operating Officer: ""You can just see that this car will be faster than last year's. It's got the right sweeps and curves on it - it's the very latest iteration of what an F1 car should be.""
Mike Gascoyne, Chief Technical Officer: ""I think that basically this car looks like a front-running car in every area. We said very clearly that we want to start challenging the established teams and I think that's very achievable.""
Riad Asmat, Chief Executive Officer: ""T128 takes Team Lotus in exactly the right direction. We have said since day one of the Team Lotus dream that the plan for our second year was to take the fight to the midfield, and with this car we are all confident that is what we will be able to do.""
Team Principal Tony Fernandes: ""There has been so much focus off-track it's a thrill to be able to get back to talking about racing. The launch of the T128 is a big step forward for Team Lotus and I want to thank the whole team for the amount of hard work that has already gone into the car, and I want to thank Renault and Red Bull Technology for their tremendous support in helping us make this step forward and for being such great team partners."""
Toro Rosso STR6 Ferrari,"Shortly after 9 o'clock on February 1st, in the pit lane at Valencia's Ricardo Tormo circuit, Jaime Alguersuari and Sebastien Buemi pulled the wraps off the STR 6, the car with which Scuderia Toro Rosso will tackle the 2011 Formula 1 World Championship. While the livery featuring the famous red bull remains pretty much the same, underneath the paintwork, the STR6 is radically different to its predecessor.
This year's design is possibly less conservative than in 2010 and naturally takes into account the requirements set out in the technical regulation changes, such as the banning of double diffusers, blown rear wings and adjustable front wings, to be replaced with the arrival of adjustable rear wings and the return, after a one year break, of KERS."
Virgin MVR-02 Cosworth,"Marussia Virgin Racing unveiled their 2011 season challenger - the MVR-02 - at the BBC's Television Centre in London. They also took the opportunity to outline the team's vision for 2011 and beyond following last week's management restructure.
As with the VR-01, the aerodynamics of the MVR-02 have been designed entirely using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) now using the most powerful supercomputer allowed by current agreements.
As already announced, the driver line-up for the 20 Grands Prix on the 2011 Formula One World Championship calend consists of Germany's Timo Glock and Belgium's Jerome d'Ambrosio, who makes his Formula One debut with the team this season.
The car is the first to bear the MVR chassis designation, following Russian performance car manufacturer Marussia's acquisition of a significant stake in the team at the end of last season.
Marussia Virgin Racing bucked the trend of a trackside roll-out and instead opted to reveal the MVR-02 during a recorded television production - 'An Audience with Marussia Virgin Racing' - which took place in front of a packed audience of Media and Team Partners at the famous television studios. True to the team's commitment to its burgeoning fan base, Marussia Virgin Racing also welcomed a large contingent of its social media followers to the event and they were at the heart of the action as the wraps came off the new car in Studio 1."
Williams FW33 Cosworth,"In a recent interview, Rubens Barrichello described this year's Williams- Cosworth FW33 as ""aggressive"". It's a sentiment shared by technical director Sam Michael, who talks today about the team's 2011 FIA Formula One World Championship entry, the Williams Cosworth FW33, as it makes its track debut in Valencia this morning.
""Until you start testing,"" says Sam, ""you're never sure how you're going to stack up against the opposition, but we're optimistic. We think this is a good car, but we'll have a better overall picture in a few weeks time.""
New rules, which were only confirmed by the FIA's World Motorsport Council in June 2010, compelled Williams F1's technical team to take an innovative approach to its new car. The ban on double diffusers and the F-duct forced the aerodynamicists to seek new downforce solutions; KERS had to be incorporated into the layout and the team had to prepare for the arrival of a new tyre supplier, Pirelli, for the first time in five years.
""The design of this year's car has been pretty smooth,"" continues Sam. ""We've improved our way of working by increasing the communication between the mechanical and aerodynamic departments, and that improved our decision making processes. It allowed us to increase the optimisation time spent on each part of the car.""
The car seen at today's Valencia test is the first iteration of the FW33. This 'launch spec' will be replaced by an aero upgrade at the first race in Bahrain and there will be many others during the course of the year. Sam Michael and his technical team expect aerodynamic performance to reach the same levels as 2010, despite there being less aero freedom in the rules.
Aerodynamic work started in December 2009, with the mechanical aspects of the FW33 beginning in March 2010. The major layout decisions were finalised in June, following the World Motorsport Council's confirmation of the 2011 rule changes, and the new gearbox was on the dyno by September. The launch spec aerodynamic package was completed in November, since when the aero team has focused on the first-race upgrade.
The seven-speed 'box is the smallest ever produced by Williams F1 and works in conjunction with the new pull-rod rear suspension. ""With gearbox usage increasing from four to five races this year,"" says Sam, ""reliability is vital. But I'm not expecting it to be a problem because the new gearbox has the same stiffness characteristics as the old one and the rulebook forces us to be conservative with the internals. For the last few seasons the ratios have to be 12mm wide and 600g per pair, whereas in the past we were down to 8-9mm gears.""
Williams F1 was one of only three teams to introduce a double diffuser at the beginning of 2009. The team optimised the design on last year's FW32, but it has now been banned.
""The double diffuser ban is pretty significant,"" says Sam. ""Not only can you not open any holes between the reference and step planes, you must have continuous material through all lateral and longitudinal sections. The scope for developing anything on the diffuser is limited, so we're looking at the centre, rear and front of the floor, as well as the sides of the floor and the little area around the tyre spat, all of which are still free.
""The ban on double diffusers should tighten up the field. It will probably happen straight away, but even if it doesn't and someone comes to the first or second test with something you hadn't thought of elsewhere on the car, it'll be easy to replicate it and get it onto the car quickly because it shouldn't affect the underlying car structure such as the gearbox.""
Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) were permitted in 2009, before being outlawed in 2010. Now they're back to stay. The system recovers the kinetic energy present in the waste heat created by the brakes and the exhausts. The energy is then stored in a battery, converted into power and a maximum of 60kw can be called upon by the driver to boost acceleration for up to 6.6s per lap.
Williams Hybrid Power (WHP) is developing a flywheel KERS for use in industry. The system was tested in an F1 car in '09, but the current regulations favour the use of the battery system, which Williams F1 assembles and builds in-house.
""The rules have changed since KERS was last used in F1,"" says Sam. ""Re-fuelling is no longer permitted, so the packaging is different now. We have packaged our KERS system entirely inside the car's survival cell, below the fuel tank, because we didn't want to compromise any of the sidepod area for aerodynamics. The car is longer than last year as a result, but the advantages of doing that outweigh the negatives. Assuming you're on the weight limit, there is no downside to KERS; it's worth 0.3s and it gives you a better start.""
One of the most controversial rule changes for 2011 is the introduction of a moveable rear wing. The top element of the wing has to be able to lift at the front until the slot gap is 50mm and it's hoped that the resultant reduction in drag will increase speeds by up to 15km/h. The wing's sole purpose is to make overtaking easier, but not everyone is convinced.
""I don't think the advantage gained by the rear wing is going to change overtaking dramatically,"" says Sam, ""because there isn't going to be a big enough drag reduction. You only get help from the wing when you're one second from the car in front, which might not be until halfway down a straight, depending on where the FIA places the timing loop that activates it. That will take a few races to fine tune.
""It's another thing for the drivers to think about. Our system is powered by a hydraulic actuator, which is activated by a button on the steering wheel. By regulation there is no intermediate position control; it's either on or off.""
After 14 years at the top echelon, Bridgestone pulled out of F1 at the end of 2010. Replacing the Japanese company as the sport's sole tyre supplier for the next three years is Pirelli, who were last involved in F1 in 1991. The dimensions of the tyres will be the same as last year, but the performance characteristics are very different, as Williams F1 discovered during a two-day evaluation of the tyres in Abu Dhabi last November.
""The Abu Dhabi test was quite useful,"" says Sam. ""There is a change to the aerodynamics; lots of little details make a difference to the wake of the tyre and we learnt a lot about that in Abu Dhabi. The Pirelli rubber deflects and deforms in a different way to that of Bridgestone and it has different mould lines, all of which can affect the tyre wake.
""Overall, though, the arrival of Pirelli is not an intimidating change. We didn't change a lot on the mechanical side of the new car after the Abu Dhabi test; the main changes we've made since then have been aero.""
The minimum weight of the cars has gone up from 620kg to 640kg this year. KERS has added mass to the car, as has the addition of more anti-penetration zylon panels to the sides of the chassis (they now go all the way to the drivers' feet) and the need for double wheel tethers.
The weight distribution is fixed at 46 percent on the front axle, plus or minus 0.5 percent. That's more rigid than in the past, but Sam doesn't believe it's a game changer. ""The weight distribution is pretty close to where we were running on Bridgestones,"" he says. ""It wasn't a big issue when it came to designing this car. However, the extra weight has forced us to increase our brake cooling. The cars will be doing higher top speeds due to KERS and the moveable rear wing, and in the slow corners the extra mass will have an influence, so the brakes will have to work harder.""
Unprecedented levels of R&D have gone into this year's FW33 and a development programme is in place to ensure that upgrades are introduced at each grand prix of the 20-race campaign. ""Our ambition is get back to the front of the grid,"" says Frank Williams. ""We know that won't be easy, but we hope this car will take us closer to the leaders than we were in 2010. As a team, we're as ambitious now as we've ever been.""
The team now has 15 days of testing at four different racetracks ahead of the opening race of the season. Valencia, Jerez, Barcelona and Bahrain offer different challenges and varying climates, after which it'll be time to go racing; time to stand up and be counted."
Alpine A524 Renault,"The A524 is a brand-new concept created for the next two seasons and is marked by innovative solutions as a result of learnings from previous iterations. The bold approach will allow the team to apply a stronger development path across the next two campaigns before the radical change in technical regulations following that.
For 2024, the team is loyally supported by title partner BWT and its premium partners bp, Castrol, and Renault E-Tech. As a result, the livery has been designed in collaboration with contemporary artist Felipe Pantone to bring a fresh and unique vision to the car design. Using black as its core, the colours are an embodiment of traditional Alpine blue, the predominant colour for the campaign, matched with the now world-renowned pink colours of BWT. The livery will be inverted to be pink dominated at eight rounds of the 2024 season.
Esteban, Pierre and the team will take on Formula 1’s record breaking 24-race calendar, which spans 11 months of the year, covering five continents and begins in February in Bahrain and ends in Abu Dhabi in December. The calendar also includes the return to Shanghai for the Chinese Grand Prix for the first time since 2019.
Renault Group remains dedicated to the Formula 1 project buoyed by the valued support of CEO Luca De Meo. Formula 1 continues to be a key pillar in ‘Renaultlution’ under the Alpine brand, headed by CEO Philippe Krief.
Motorsport is the core of Alpine’s DNA and the brand’s commitment to racing is highlighted in the fact it is the most involved of any car company in FIA racing categories with presence in Formula 1, World Endurance, open-wheel racing and rallying."
Aston Martin AMR24 Mercedes,"The Aston Martin Aramco Formula One® Team presented its new challenger for the 2024 season – the AMR24. On a significant day for Aston Martin, the new Vantage road car and Aston Martin Vantage GT3 join the AMR24 - marking a trilogy of reveals.
In its iconic racing green livery, complete with Aramco title partner branding, the AMR24 represents a strong and exciting evolution from its predecessor which catapulted the team to eight podiums and 280 points in 2023. The AMR24 evolves the same design philosophy but there is minor carryover with the majority of the parts being new for 2024. The continuous refinement of the AMR24 has resulted in a lighter, more aerodynamically efficient race car, designed to operate across a wider range of circuits.
“We are proud to debut the AMR24,” said Team Principal, Mike Krack. “It is the result of a huge effort by the whole team at our new AMR Technology Campus and it will allow the team to take another step forward in 2024. Since the last race in 2023, everyone has been hyper-focused on improvements in every area, concentrating our efforts on what really makes a difference, what really matters to be better. Almost every area of the car has been refined and improved, building on our strengths, and taking on board the lessons of the previous campaign. 2023 was our best season to date and our goal this season is to score regular points, podiums, and fight for our first win in green.”
Dan Fallows, Technical Director explains how the team approached the AMR24: “Even with the stable regulations, there are endless possibilities for refinement. I would call the AMR24 a strong evolution of last year’s car and it does look quite different with many new parts to give us a strong platform for development. The chassis design is new, as well as the nose, front wing, front suspension and rear suspension.  We want to compete in the development race this season and this car is designed to do just that.
“Another area of focus has been to broaden the car’s operating window. We have focused on more versatility for a wider range of specific circuit characteristics. We want a race car that is more of an all-rounder. We believe the AMR24 provides the ideal platform for in-season development and a sustained season-long challenge.”
The front wing design has been altered to help manage front wheel wake in a more efficient manner. Combined with the over-wheel winglets, the aim is to control the wake from the front tyres and direct it away from the rest of the car to allow the other downforce-producing surfaces to work more efficiently.
The current era of F1 regulations have placed huge emphasis on the floor and sidepod design. On the AMR24, an overhaul of the sidepods and bodywork has been undertaken to improve airflow management around the floor and over the rear wing.
“The floor is the biggest area of downforce generation on an F1 car and it’s constantly being evolved. Getting it right will be of paramount importance to our success in 2024,” says Dan.
The AMR24 will utilise a push-rod suspension layout both front and rear. This sees the wheel assembly joined to the chassis by a diagonal structure, with a higher point on the car’s body.
The front suspension has been changed to improve performance in conjunction with the front wing and floor while the rear suspension has been optimised to maximise efficiency of air flow around the rear wing, accommodating Mercedes’ latest power unit and gearbox.
Dan explains: “Work has been done on both ends of the car’s suspension. The front will work more efficiently alongside the front wing, and aero work has been done at the rear to optimise our layout in that area.”"
Ferrari SF-24,"The Ferrari SF-24 was launched in front of a small audience of guests today, while the rest of the world watched online. It is the 70th car the company has built to take part in the Formula 1 World Championship. Attending the presentation at the Fiorano track were President John Elkann, CEO Benedetto Vigna and Vice-President Piero Ferrari, along with representatives of the partners, as well as team members, starting with Team Principal Fred Vasseur and the drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz. The busiest season ever, with no fewer than 24 races, gets underway next week in Bahrain with the only pre-season three-day test session, followed by the first grand prix at the same venue, on Saturday 2 March.
Concept. The SF-24 is the third car of the new Formula 1 ground effect generation, but it breaks with the tradition of the past two years, starting with the look of it. The design group, led by Enrico Cardile, aimed to give Charles and Carlos a car that is easy to drive and that reacts predictably, with as a starting point, the positive feeling the drivers had in the cockpit over the final few races of last season. The goal is to allow them to make the most of the power unit’s potential, combined with their undoubted skill behind the wheel.
Colours and details. At first glance, the car is aesthetically very different to its predecessors and this also goes for the livery. Following a positive reception in Las Vegas last November, white makes its return together with yellow – always Ferrari’s second colour –, an evident link with Modena but also a nod to the Maranello marque’s other main racing activity apart from Formula 1, namely the World Endurance Championship. As was the case last year, the SF-24 and the WEC 499P share the same shade of red, again this year with a matt finish on the Formula 1 car. It’s not the first time that a Ferrari Formula 1 car has featured yellow, although the yellow longitudinal stripes have not been seen since 1968, while this year, for the very first time, it’s paired with white. There is therefore less black on the car than in previous years, now restricted to the floor, the bargeboards, part of the halo and other small areas. The wheels are red with a double white and yellow stripe, these colours also featuring on the race numbers – 16 and 55 – which continue to use the Maranello marque’s official font, Ferrari Sans, this time in italics.
First kilometres. The SF-24 will run on track for the first time for filming, photographic, marketing and communications purposes, but of course these first few kilometres give the team a chance to carry out a shakedown and allow the drivers to get an initial idea of how the car behaves on track, having assessed it on the simulator in recent weeks.
Fred Vasseur, Team Principal: “Presenting a new car to the world for the first time is always a very exciting moment for me and the drivers, even if we are all already thinking about the moment we will go head to head with our rivals on track. This year, we must start off where we left off at the end of last season, when we were consistent front runners, with a view to constantly improving in all areas. The longest ever Formula 1 season awaits us and Charles, Carlos and I all agree, we must be more cinical and effective in how we manage the races, making bold choices, in order to get the best possible result at every Grand Prix. It’s often said that your fans can give you an extra gear and that will definitely be true in what will be a very closely contested championship and we are proud to know we can count on our “tifosi” from around the world.”
Charles Leclerc, Driver #16: “I like the look of the car a lot, including the white and yellow parts on the bodywork. But of course, what really interests me is how it will perform on track, as that’s all that matters. The SF-24 ought to be less sensitive and easier to drive and for us drivers that’s what you need in order to do well. I expect the car to be a step forward in several areas and from the impression I formed in the simulator I think we’re where we want to be. This season the aim is to be front runners all the time and I want to give our fans plenty to cheer about, by dedicating race wins to them.”
Carlos Sainz, driver #55: “When I saw the SF-24 for the first time, I couldn’t wait to jump in and fire it up. Now, I’m looking forward to driving it on track to see if it correlates with the feeling I had from the simulator, which is that it’s the step forward we all want. The aim is to have a car that’s more driveable and therefore able to run at a consistent race pace, as these are the basic requirements to fight for wins. We drivers have done our very best to give the engineers precise feedback and I’m sure the workforce in Maranello will have listened to our needs. We want to give the fans something to cheer about, as they were so supportive last year, even when things weren’t going our way.”
Enrico Cardile, Technical Director Chassis: “With the SF-24 we wanted to create a completely new platform and in fact, every area of the car has been redesigned, even if our starting point was the development direction we adopted last year and which saw us take a leap forward in terms of competitiveness in the final part of the season. We have taken on board what the drivers told us and turned those ideas into engineering reality, with the aim of giving them a car that’s easier to drive and therefore easier to get the most out of and push it to its limits. We did not set ourselves any design constraints other than that of delivering a strong and honest racing car, which can reproduce on the race track what we have seen in the wind tunnel.”
Enrico Gualtieri, Technical Director Power Unit: “Even though power unit development is frozen by the regulations, it doesn’t mean that 2024 does not present some interesting challenges. We will be tackling more races than in any other year of the championship and that will require us to react more quickly, with fewer hours available on the test bed. To prepare for this, we have reviewed all the processes relating to the engine - preparation, signing-off and management - in order to maximise performance. Furthermore, we have worked very closely with our partners to further optimise procedures relating to reliability: for example, at the track, thanks to the regular monitoring of the fluids in the car, Shell is able to constantly check on the state of health of the power unit.”"
Haas VF-24 Ferrari,"MoneyGram Haas F1 Team showcased the dynamic look of the VF-24 entry to be raced in the 2024 FIA Formula 1 World Championship by Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen.
Title partner MoneyGram, a leading global financial technology company that connects the world's communities, feature prominently on the engine cover and both front and rear wing, with Haas Automation – the global CNC machine tool company founded by team owner Gene Haas, maintaining its placement on the sidepods and rear wing. Haas Tooling, Palm Angels, Chipotle, OAKBERRY, Tricorp, TravisMathew, Alpinestars and Pirelli are all represented with logo placements on the VF-24 entry.
The 2024 season will also see existing partner Play’n GO, the global leader in supplying entertainment to the casino industry and the creator of some of the world’s most played online casino games, increase their partnership commitment with the team. This multi-year partnership will see additional branding for Play’n GO across the VF-24, team and driver assets.
“I’m looking forward to seeing the VF-24 running and racing – a sentiment I know I share with our partners and indeed the entire team,” said Gene Haas, Chairman of MoneyGram Haas F1 Team. “In Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen, we also know we’ve got a great pair of drivers behind the wheel, their experience will prove invaluable again as we develop our program through the year. We’ve used the off-season to put the processes in place to be better and ultimately improve our overall performance. Soon we get to see how we’re doing.""
“As we head into our second year of title partnership with the team, we’re extremely proud that our name and logo are such an integral part of the beautifully designed VF-24,” said Alex Holmes, MoneyGram Chief Executive Officer. “Last year, our partnership helped MoneyGram to deliver cut-through branding, accelerate brand awareness and boost customer engagement, so we’re excited to see what this season has in store. With just about a month until the first race on the 2024 calendar, we can’t wait to cheer on the MoneyGram Haas F1 Team!”
“We’re realistic about our expectations for the VF-24 to start but it’s still an exciting moment in any Formula 1 season to showcase the car,” commented Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal of MoneyGram Haas F1 Team. “There’s a lot of work ahead of us to make progress and increase our performance but everyone here is highly motivated and eager to get on track with the VF-24. I know we’ll be maximizing our time in Bahrain with all the various items we need to push through. Bottom line, we can’t wait to get going and get the season underway.”"
McLaren MCL38 Mercedes,"McLaren revealed the new MCL38 a few days ahead of the only official test session for the 2024 Formula 1 World Championship. On the same day, it was given a brief shakedown at the Silverstone circuit.
Thanks to the stable regulations, the MCL38 is very much an evolution of the MCL60 that really came on song during the second half of the 2023 season. The development focused primarily on refining the complicated ground effect aerodynamics. The Mercedes-AMG F1 drivetrain was once again and drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri were also retained.
Following the brief shakedown at Silverstone, the McLaren Racing team will switch the focus to Bahrain for the three-day test and subsequent season opening Grand Prix."
Mercedes-AMG W15 E Performance,"In the immediate aftermath of a disappointing 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix, the team looked hard in the mirror at every aspect of our operations. A new direction was set, beginning a period of renewal. Despite the limitations of the W14’s pre-existing architecture, there was tangible progress. A hard-fought, year-long battle netted second in the Constructors’ Championship. The mission continues into 2024.
“We know we have a mountain to climb to fight at the very front. There are no miracles in this sport,” Toto Wolff, Team Principal & CEO of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team, commented. “But our ambition and determination are strong. Since charting this new course, development has progressed well. We had several items on our priority list for this car. We will soon see if we’ve made the step we’ve aimed for.”
“The design of any car is an iterative process. And a long one at that,” Technical Director James Allison explained. “It stretches back to last year. A new car enables the team to make bigger alterations that are not possible during the season. These are decisions that are taken during the preceding summer.”
These changes include a new chassis, and new gearbox casing. Aerodynamically, as ever, the focus has been on efficiency. The endless quest for finding more downforce with less drag and delivering it to the track in a manner that complements the function of the suspension and tyres.
“A big focus has been on improving the previous car’s unpredictable rear axle,” James continued. “We have worked hard to ensure that both axles, but particularly the rear axle, retain better control of the tyre than on the W14. There’s also been some housekeeping on areas in which we had room for improvement, including the DRS effect, and pit stop performance.”
However, it is the underside of the car where the main differentiating factors lie. James added: “With this current generation of cars, so much of the performance comes from how the floor interacts with the road. Whether or not a car is effective is down to how well that floor is permitted to behave aerodynamically.
“We feel like we have had a good winter, but F1 is a relative game and only time will tell how big a step we’ve made. We’re focused on getting the most from the car we launch, but we are excited by the development race that will follow as the regulations are still young and opportunities abound,” James concluded.
Toto added: “As the saying goes: when it stings, it sticks. I believe the previous two years were necessary for us to readjust, recalibrate and reinvent ourselves in certain areas. That root-and-branch approach is never easy. But we’ve made progress and look forward to taking the next step with the W15. It won’t be a linear path, but when we stumble, we will get back up and keep climbing.”
Another visible difference with the W15? The livery. In a year when the iconic Silver Arrows mark their 90th anniversary, the famous silver returns to complement the iconic black of recent seasons.
“Performance was always at the forefront of our minds with the black livery last year,” Toto explained. “Weight is a crucial factor in this current generation of cars. We knew that, once we were in position to do so, we would bring back the Mercedes silver to accompany the black that has become a pillar of our team identity. The livery truly reflects who we are as a team with the distinctive colours of INEOS and PETRONAS providing important highlights.”
The nose section therefore transforms to silver, with the iconic three-pointed star pattern on the engine cover. The distinguished INEOS ‘Toto Rosso’ red features predominantly on the rear-wing and roll hoop in a nod to INEOS Sport, with PETRONAS green providing a dynamic flow across the car.
The new livery reflects the team’s commercial strength, as does recent news. Blue-chip brands such as SAP, WhatsApp, and Luminar have all joined the team’s partner ecosystem in recent months.
“Our commercial strategy has evolved over recent years,” Toto explained. “We have always been focused on building long-term relationships with partners that share our values and delivering clear return on investment. We have now made the conscious decision to refine our partner ecosystem. We want to concentrate on a smaller, select group of partners, to better serve and deliver on their return on investment. We pride ourselves on trying to be the very best in every single area, and we believe this approach is the way we can achieve this with our partners.”
Behind-the-wheel of the W15 will be race drivers Lewis Hamilton and George Russell."
RB VCARB 01 RBPT Honda,"The dazzling lights on Las Vegas Boulevard provided the backdrop to the launch of the Visa Cash App RB Formula One Team ahead of the 2024 Formula 1 season. The very special event, revealing the team’s new look and welcoming new partners, was equally dazzling.
Star of the evening was our new car, the VCARB 01, with its sparkling blue and white livery reflecting the team’s new colours. Present were Peter Bayer, Visa Cash App RB’s CEO and Team Principal Laurent Mekies, who were joined on stage by our drivers, eight times Grand Prix winner Daniel Ricciardo from Australia and the exciting Japanese youngster, Yuki Tsunoda. Alongside them was Amna Al-Qubaisi, the Emirati who is carrying the Visa Cash App RB colours in this year’s F1 Academy championship.
Entertainment came courtesy of major names from the music industry in the shape of rapper, singer-songwriter and Pulitzer Prize winner Kendrick Lamar, and the multi-award winning rapper and record producer, Baby Keem.
The enthusiasm and energy of the evening mirrors that of the Visa Cash App RB team going into the new Formula 1 World Championship season. Together with our new partners, we are aiming to raise the bar and push ourselves towards the front of the starting grid."
Red Bull Racing RB20 RBPT Honda,"Red Bull Racing absolutely dominated the 2022 and 2023 Formula 1 World Championship and looked to carry on this form during the 2024 season. Where the successful RB18 evolved in the RB19, the new-for-2024 RB20 represents a more dramatic departure from the earlier designs.
Interestingly, the Adrian Newey led design team have taken inspiration from previous, disappointing Mercedes Grand Prix cars. As with the failed Mercedes designs, the focus was on minimising the side-pod size to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Among the other distinct features of the RB20 are the prominent canon outlets mounted behind the HALO on either side of the central air-intake. These are understood to channel hot air from the radiators and intercoolers to the rear of the car.
That the zero side-pod layout still has merit was underlined by defending World Champion Max Verstappen on the first day of testing when he easily topped the charts. On day two, Sergio Perez ran into some technical issues but was still second fastest."
Sauber C44 Ferrari,"It’s not the kind of Formula One car you’ve ever seen before. Aggressive, exciting, different – both on track and off it: the Stake F1 Team C44 is finally in the open and it’s already got the world of motorsport talking.
The 2024 challenger of Stake F1 Team was unveiled in the historic setting of London’s Guildhall, but there was nothing conventional or staid about it. There was an edginess to the event, the feeling of being at the start of a new era, to be witnessing the birth of a new way of doing racing: but, despite the stars in attendance and the glitz of the set-up, all eyes were on the new car. As Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, our 2024 race drivers, looked on, the team lifted the covers off an impressive piece of engineering, the latest work of art to come out of Hinwil.
Clad in an attractive black and Fluo Racing Green livery – the shiny, viridescent hue itself the result of impressive development work by team partners, BASF – the look and feel of the C44 redefines what to expect on track. It’s an eye-catcher, a head-turner, the centre of attention on every TV screen, the point of focus in every photograph. It’s not the usual F1 car: it’s not a tribute to the past, but a nod to a new and exciting future, one that incorporates everything that is great about our sport, and elevates it to the next level.
The C44 is the result of the indefatigable work of hundreds of people back in Hinwil, who for months on end designed, developed, produced and finally assembled the new car with a growing sense of excitement. It’s the product of the determination of a technical team, led by Technical Director, James Key, to make a decisive step forward in the pecking order, to go back fighting where the team aims to fight.
The C44 is a marked departure from its predecessor, the C43: a slew of changes has been introduced – some very visible, some more subtle – to bring performance to the package and open up new areas of development. The most visible, and perhaps most consequential, is the shift to a new pull-rod front suspension, compared to the push-rod system sported on the C43: the shift is testament to the solid work produced by the team in Hinwil, which committed vast resources to it, and is driven mostly by the desire to unlock the aerodynamics benefits of the pull-rod arrangement.
The C44 sports also an aggressively redesigned aero package, with marked development evident in the sidepods and engine cover, which are taking existing concepts to new extremes and display the team’s ability to package the car in reduced spaces, a change that also required the redesign of many of the car’s internals; and a completely new floor, a key area to generating downforce. And, with the new development avenues opened by the choices made in the creation of the C44, the design team is already busy finalising some important updates that will be brought to track in the opening rounds of the championship, as the team intends to be a strong player in the development race.
As always, the proof is in the pudding: the C44 will get its first test of track action on Friday, during a shakedown in Barcelona, before travelling to Bahrain for the three days of testing that mark the official start of the season. Only then, and in the following week’s Grand Prix, we will know just how good the C44 is: for now, we know it already tops the standings for the most daring, aggressive and disruptive car out there."
Williams FW46 Mercedes,"Williams Racing’s 2024 Formula 1 challenger, the FW46, made its on-track debut during a pre-season promotional filming day at the Bahrain International Circuit ahead of the Official Pre-Season Test. Alex Albon and Logan Sargeant shared driving duties across the 200 kilometres of running as they completed their first laps in the new car.
Design, development and production of the FW46 have been the focus of the team for many months, with this moment signifying an enormous effort from everyone at Grove, and at the track, as Williams Racing takes the next step on the long-term journey back to the front of the grid. Williams has made F1 history before with 16 World Championships and 114 race wins and is out to make history again.
The design of the FW46 is in line with the minor FIA Technical Regulation changes outlined for 2024, continuing to focus on cost cap efficiencies and promoting closer racing. To address sport-wide safety concerns, the FW46 includes changes to the homologation tests for both the primary roll hoop structure at the top of the chassis, and the front wheel tethers. There is a change to regulations regarding the detailed design of the floor edge. The FW46 respects these updates, with the remainder of the design dictated by the trade-off between performance improvement and cost-cap restrictions.
An updated chassis design has been incorporated into the FW46, which is married to a 2024-specification Mercedes-Benz Power Unit and in turn to a Mercedes-Benz gearbox. For 2024, the rear suspension is also provided by Mercedes-Benz, with the front suspension being an in-house Williams Racing design. Aerodynamically, the FW46 builds on the experience gained from the FW45 and incorporates a much higher level of detailed design in all the critical areas.
The filming day also marked the track debut of the team’s new partners and livery that was unveiled in New York on February 5. The livery blends past glory with future aspirations featuring a vibrant colour transition from Heritage Navy Blue to New Era Williams. A red and white pinstripe, reflecting Williams’ position as a British icon and inspired by historic cars is meticulously integrated for a classy yet powerful look. Branding from new partners Komatsu and VAST Data add to this year’s energetic design alongside our existing partners, and the filming day also marked the first track outing for our driver racewear and official team kit provided by PUMA."
Alfa Romeo Racing C43 Ferrari,"Lean, mean and absolutely gorgeous. Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake unveiled its 2023 challenger, the C43, at a launch event held jointly in Zurich and at the team headquarters in Hinwil, Switzerland, and the world of Formula One has an early contender for the title of most beautiful car on the grid already. The C43, in a striking livery of red and black, will guide Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu in the 2023 World Championship as the team seeks to continue on its path of constant improvement.
As the drivers pulled the covers from the car in the team’s Hinwil base, a series of CGI images and videos of the C43 were released to media and fans alike, bringing the new Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake car to life in all its glory. In an impressive unveil video, the C43 emerged from raw materials and atomised parts, the resulting assembly symbolising the way the team is a union of individuals that come together, each playing an important part in ensuring Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake’s success. In a further enhancement of the fan experience, the C43 was also made available in Augmented Reality, for all fans to bring it into their homes, in an interactive journey developed by team partners, JigSpace.
In a further push to bring the car back to the community, the C43 show car unveiled by the drivers was put on auction, via Memento Exclusives on www.f1authentics.com, with the bids opening at the same time of the drivers’ presentation on stage.
The livery, designed by Alfa Romeo’s Centro Stile, incorporates the growing array of brands associated with the team, with prominent locations for Alfa Romeo and new title partner, Stake, as well as new acquisitions which underline the team’s growing attractiveness to businesses in all kinds of sectors. Over the last few season, Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake has emerged as a leader, among Formula One teams, in finding fresh approaches to marketing, with unrivalled levels of access and a constant push for innovation that extends beyond technical matters.
Following the Hinwil unveil, the drivers then joined Team Representative, Alessandro Alunni Bravi, and Technical Director, Jan Monchaux, as well as reserve driver, Théo Pourchaire, at the TV studios in Zurich to meet a selection of fans, brought closer to the team for this occasion, and to take part in an online press conference with international media.
Designed by the technical team led by Jan Monchaux and powered by a new Ferrari power unit, the C43 is an evolution of last year’s successful challenger, the C42: however, due to the circumscribed but significant changes in the regulations brought in by the FIA, the C43 incorporates several updates and complete new parts, with its overall development path still promising a steep improvement curve.
The car shed its “winter livery”, a work of art by graffiti artist BOOGIE, and it’s now ready to hit the track in a shakedown session, scheduled for this week in Barcelona, and for winter testing in Bahrain, at the end of the month."
AlphaTauri AT04 RBPT Honda,"Scuderia AlphaTauri and AlphaTauri Fashion have taken The Big Apple by storm this week, culminating in a unique event this evening at the Lincoln Centre during New York Fashion Week, that saw the pair unveil the 2023 Formula 1 livery alongside AlphaTauri’s 2023 Autumn/Winter collection.
The team had an action-packed week in New York City, kicking off with a jersey swap with the Red Bull New York Bulls, then watching NBA courtside at the Barclays Centre with the Brooklyn Nets and ending at the P448 store, where Yuki Tsunoda and Nyck de Vries shopped for sneakers ahead of the launch event.
Tonight, at The Appel Room of the Lincoln Centre, key stakeholders in the fashion and motorsport world were able to capture an exclusive look at both the new car livery and upcoming fashion collection, whilst taking in the spectacular Central Park backdrop. In parallel to the live event, a digital reveal gave fans globally the opportunity to catch a first glimpse of the 2023 livery, which features the prominent red of the team’s new Principal Partner PKN ORLEN, together with the newest fashion collection. Furthermore, the event flagged the brands’ first key US milestone, in what is a pivotal year for both Formula 1 and AlphaTauri fashion in America, as F1 adds a third US date to its calendar and 2023 sees AlphaTauri enter the market for the very first time.
Franz Tost, Scuderia AlphaTauri Team Principal, said: “As we know, Formula 1 has seen a huge increase in popularity due to the likes of Netflix and social media over the last few years. So, it’s extremely important that we continue to grow in this market, which is why I’m pleased we were able to launch our 2023 livery here today in New York City to show our appreciation to the US audience. Likewise, I think it’s great that AlphaTauri could display their new collection at the event, as this year is the first time they’ll sell their clothing here in America.”
Yuki Tsunoda commented: “I’ve had a lot of fun this week in New York City and it’s also been great to attend the event here today, it’s such a cool backdrop for both the fashion collection and our new 2023 livery. The classic Scuderia AlphaTauri colours looks great next to the new clothes and I can’t wait to try both out this season!”
Nyck de Vries added: “I’ve loved attending my first event as a Scuderia AlphaTauri driver, the opportunity to represent the brand at New York Fashion Week has been extremely special for me, and really showed me what the brand is about. The livery looks great, and you can see how the sleek A/W collection has inspired it, so I can’t wait to see it on track.”
“Entering the US market is another step in our expansion”, said Ahmet Mercan, AlphaTauri CEO. “Our goal is to make AlphaTauri better known and we are convinced that the consistent expansion of our sales network will make an important contribution to this.”"
Alpine A523 Renault,"BWT Alpine F1 Team unveiled its 2023 FIA Formula 1 World Championship contender – the A523 – in front of a start-studded live audience at London’s Printworks as the team gets set to compete in Formula 1’s 23-race global campaign.
Buoyed by its clear trajectory in the Championship having finished fifth in 2021 and fourth in 2022, Alpine enters 2023 with bold targets as it continues its climb towards the front of the grid within the 100-race plan.
The A523 is a significant evolution from its predecessor, the A522, which has seen radical development over the winter months, led hand in hand by the design and technical teams at its bases in Enstone, United Kingdom and Viry-Châtillon, France.
The car livery is yet again a striking design, combining the iconic colours of Alpine blue with the dashing pink of the team’s title partner BWT. On the night, the team also confirmed its reversed, full pink livery for the opening three Grand Prix of the season in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo and Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi attended the event to unveil the car to the world as well as reaffirming the ambitions and strategy behind Alpine’s presence in Formula 1 in line with Renault Group’s Renaulution framework.
The team officially unveiled its new 2023 driver line-up in team colours for the first time with Esteban Ocon – in his fourth year at the team – joined by compatriot Pierre Gasly who was announced as an BWT Alpine F1 Team driver last October. The pairing is an emotional and compelling story, given the duo grew up in Normandy and first met as aspiring race drivers at nine years of age. Since then, both Esteban and Pierre have risen through the racing ranks to Formula 1 – each picking up a landmark Grand Prix victory – and now together to lead the only French team on the Formula 1 grid.
Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer begins his second year at the helm having helped guide the team to its impressive fourth place in the 2022 Constructors’ Championship. Otmar was joined by Technical Director Matt Harman who outlined the team’s design philosophy in enhancing the A523, as well as explaining how both sites across Enstone – for chassis – and Viry – for the power unit – have worked hand in hand to improve the team’s overall package.
Jack Doohan becomes the team’s official Reserve Driver for 2023 alongside his duties in racing in the FIA Formula 2 Championship.
Esteban and Pierre have enjoyed a busy pre-season preparing for the demands of the 23-race calendar and drove the A523 for the first time on Monday in the team’s official filming day at Silverstone.
Both drivers will again share duties at the upcoming Formula 1 pre-season test in Bahrain before the first race of the season in Sakhir takes place on March 5."
Aston Martin AMR23 Mercedes,"In front of a packed audience in its new Silverstone headquarters, the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Formula One™ Team (AMF1) unveiled its 2023 Grand Prix challenger, the AMR23.
This season’s race drivers Lance Stroll and double F1 World Drivers’ Champion Fernando Alonso took to the stage to reveal the new car alongside Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll and Team Principal Mike Krack.
The AMR23 is a considerable evolution of last year’s chassis, which was honed across the season into a consistent points challenger. In year three of the team’s ambitious journey as Aston Martin, the aim is to deliver a car that will be competitive from the outset.
Lawrence Stroll, AMF1 Executive Chairman, said: “This year’s move into our new state-of-the-art factory is more than just a serious statement of intent: it will considerably strengthen and empower every single individual in this organisation, helping us to deliver on our ambition to narrow the gap to the front of the grid and, in time, become genuine championship frontrunners.
“In the past year, we have demonstrated the determination and belief needed to move forward and we have constructed a brand-new car to match our vision and ambition.
“Across our partner portfolio, I want to offer my best wishes to Ravi Kumar, who has just been appointed CEO at Cognizant, a company with whom we share an inspired vision. To the team at Aramco, who have shown incredible faith in this organisation, and to all our partners, I extend my thanks for joining us on this unique journey.
“The talk today is of new energy – and, believe me, it feels like a fresh start and an incredibly promising and ambitious way to begin the new season.”
Mike Krack, Team Principal, said: “The second half of 2022 showed real signs of progress as we worked hard on car development. For this year, our aim must be to build a car that can fully deliver on its performance potential from the first moment it hits the track.
“Making a strong start to the year, and then maintaining that momentum, is necessary if we are to make further advances towards the front of the grid. And, as an organisation, we are working hard to achieve that, and to further strengthen all areas of the team.
“We already know the proven strengths of our design, engineering and build departments – the arrival of Fernando, partnering Lance, further underlines the sheer depth and range of our driver squad. It feels like every element of this organisation is really working well together.
“Finally, we would like to thank all of our fans for their unwavering support, and we look forward to seeing you across the world this season.”
Dan Fallows, Technical Director, said: “The design team was adamant that it wanted to tackle these regulations without compromise. We want to move up the grid and start challenging the teams at the front – and you can’t do that by sitting back and being conservative.
“AMR23 is a significant development of the car we refined in the latter half of 2022 – and we have improved it in every critical area. It optimises the solutions we felt would offer us the most performance, and it embodies the joint vision we have embraced and have built together over the recent months.
“Now we need to focus on delivering an ambitious yet efficient programme of updates for the first race and across the remainder of the season.”
After last season’s wide-reaching technical changes, there is only a subtle refinement of the regulations for this year, with a few small adjustments focused on ensuring compliance and improving safety.
That technical stability has given the team the opportunity to adjust its personnel roster. For 2023, Technical Director Dan Fallows will lead the design office; Andrew Green becomes Chief Technical Officer for Aston Martin Performance Technologies, to expand and diversify the Group’s broader commercial activities.
The most notable technical changes for 2023 includes a 15mm raising of the floor limit – to mitigate against F1 ‘porpoising’ or bouncing; a more stringent vertical deflection test; and new, larger rear-view mirrors.
The consistency in the rules has also enabled the AMF1 design team to iterate and innovate in several key areas – most notably aerodynamics. The key visible differences to the AMR23 include a heavily revised front wing; new sidepods, which incorporate a sweeping inner ramp to more efficiently channel airflow; and a new engine cover with a larger roll hoop inlet."
Ferrari SF-23,"It was a St. Valentine’s Day to remember for Scuderia Ferrari fans around the world. At around lunchtime, the SF23, the Maranello marque’s challenger for the coming Formula 1 season, was unveiled at the company’s Fiorano track. It is the 69th car built by Ferrari to compete in motor racing’s blue riband category, which starts with the Bahrain Grand Prix on 5 March.
The day was full of surprises, starting with the presence of 500 fans in a grandstand specially erected at the Fiorano track, making this the first real launch to be staged after two years of virtual car presentations. Before the launch, the drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz went to greet the crowd which included many members of the various Scuderia Ferrari Clubs and students from Muner, the Motorvehicle University of Emilia-Romagna, and some from the Alfredo Ferrari Higher Education Institute, along with their teachers.
The SF-23, whose name marks a return to the format of the Scuderia Ferrari initials combined with the year of competition, as has been the case for most of the hybrid era, was first seen on video. But then came the announcement that, for the first time since 2017, the car would actually take to the track on launch day. Which of the two drivers would get behind the wheel first was decided by Fred Vasseur tossing a special coin, with Leclerc’s and Sainz’s race numbers- 16 and 55 – one on each side. Charles won and drove the SF23 for its first couple of laps, while Carlos got his turn shortly afterwards.
The SF-23 livery features some parts in naked carbon, while the historic “long F” logo appears on the rear wing. The red colour is also brand new, created by Ferrari Design: a matt version on the Formula 1 car, and glossy on the 499P Hypercar, which makes its endurance racing debut this year."
Haas VF-23 Ferrari,"MoneyGram Haas F1 Team today unveiled the sleek new livery of its VF-23 entry to be raced by Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hülkenberg throughout the 2023 FIA Formula 1 World Championship.
The livery reveal proudly reflects the new title partnership of MoneyGram International Inc. – a relationship which was first announced at last season’s United States Grand Prix with the Texas-headquartered brand joining forces with the American-owned team.
The series of digital renders, released across MoneyGram Haas F1 Team’s social media platforms, showcases a balanced blend of red, white and black on the VF-23 livery – key colors for both MoneyGram and MoneyGram Haas F1 Team. Alongside the exciting new MoneyGram branding incorporated into the design – significantly on the engine cover and front-wing, Haas Automation – the global CNC machine tool company founded by team owner Gene Haas, maintains its long-established presence in the livery featuring on the sidepods and rear-wing. Team partners Hantec Markets, Palm Angels, OpenSea, Alpinestars and Tricorp similarly enjoy logo placements on the VF-23 design.
“I was very pleased to welcome MoneyGram as title partner for the 2023 season and beyond, and it’s exciting to see our first livery unveiled together as MoneyGram Haas F1 Team,” said Gene Haas, Chairman of MoneyGram Haas F1 Team.
“We head into a new season buoyed by some strong team performances last year and a return to points paying finishes. The aim for the 2023 season is naturally to do that more consistently and with Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hülkenberg I certainly believe we’ve got an experienced driver pairing more than capable of delivering those points on a Sunday.”
“It’s been thrilling to experience two global organizations truly come together as one team to form the MoneyGram Haas F1 Team,” stated Alex Holmes, MoneyGram Chairman and CEO. “We’ve collaborated in lockstep to bring this livery to life, leaning into our many similarities while also playing off of each of our unique strengths.
""As we both usher in a brand-new era with a clear plan and vision in place, we’re prepared to work closely together to reach new heights this year. The sleek livery design is symbolic of who MoneyGram is today, a company ready for the future, and we couldn’t be more excited for what’s to come.”
“I obviously share everyone’s enthusiasm around the livery unveil, not least as it’s a checkpoint in the pre-season calendar which means we’re another step closer to doing the thing we actually want to be doing – and that’s go racing,” remarked Guenther Steiner, Team Principal of MoneyGram Haas F1 Team.
“I like the livery, it’s undoubtedly a more elevated and modernized look which is fitting as we move into a new era alongside MoneyGram as our title partner. It’s an exciting time of year for Formula 1 and it’s great that we’re first out the gate to showcase our livery but our attention is firmly on getting the VF-23 on-track and preparing for the season ahead.
""We really have something to build on following last year’s performances. The whole organization has been working hard to reach this point and obviously in Kevin (Magnussen) and Nico (Hülkenberg) we have two proven points-scoring talents locked in behind the wheel. I can’t wait to get started.”
MoneyGram Haas F1 Team will shakedown the VF-23 for the first time at Silverstone Circuit on Saturday February 11. Official pre-season testing runs from February 23-25 at the Bahrain International Circuit. The 2023 FIA Formula 1 World Championship launches with the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix March 5."
McLaren MCL60 Mercedes,"To mark McLaren’s milestone year, the team’s 2023 competitor will be named the MCL60, in a break from previous naming convention. New Zealand-born racing driver Bruce McLaren founded McLaren Racing in 1963 and since then the team have won 20 Formula 1 World Championships, 183 Formula 1 grands prix, the Indianapolis 500 three times, and the Le Mans 24 Hours at its first attempt.
The MCL60 features a striking papaya orange and blue livery, the colours first carried by the team in the 1960s, which have since become a team favourite since their reintroduction in 2018.
Designed under the leadership of Technical Director James Key and produced by the team in Woking, led by Operations Director Piers Thynne, the MCL60 will be powered by the Mercedes-AMG F1 M14 E Performance that is integrated into the McLaren chassis and gearbox with support from Mercedes HPP in Brixworth, UK.
Lando and Oscar will give the MCL60 it’s official on-track debut in the pre-season test at the Bahrain International Circuit on 23 February ahead of the opening race of the season at the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix on 5 March."
Mercedes-AMG W14 E Performance,"A new season, new challenges, and a new car. Today, the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team unveils our 2023 contender, the Mercedes-AMG F1 W14 E PERFORMANCE.
Forged in the learnings of a difficult 2022, the W14 is striking in its appearance. The underlying concept of the W13 has been retained and development focused on core performance areas. That has led to a car that retains the distinctive DNA of its predecessor and introduces a combination of notable changes that are visible on first inspection – such as the gulley bodywork on the engine cover - and others beneath the surface.
The car’s arresting look isn’t limited to the architecture, either. The iconic black livery from 2020 and 2021 has been refined as part of a significant project to reduce overall weight. Driving the W14 will be Lewis Hamilton and George Russell, who line up for their second season together, supported by Mick Schumacher in his role as third driver.
“Our hopes and expectations are always to be capable of fighting for a World Championship. However, our competitors were very strong last year, and we are playing catch-up,” said Team Principal & CEO of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team, Toto Wolff. “Racing at the front requires resilience, teamwork, and determination. We face up to every challenge, we put the Team first, and we will leave no stone unturned in the chase for every millisecond. This year, we are going all in to get back in front.”
“Last year was difficult but it came with lots of learnings,” Toto commented. “I hope 2023 will be proof that we have understood how to unravel the problems and improve the package of the car.”
“W13 certainly had performance which we never were able to unlock and put all its downforce on the ground. Our car performed very well at the end of the season. However, we still had the famous bouncing at some circuits and the car never gave the drivers good feedback, which limited them in being able to really push. We have tried to keep all the goodness of the W13 and address its weaknesses,” he continued.
The challenge of unlocking the performance in last year’s car, while troubleshooting the problems that the team could address in-season, was met head on by both Brackley and Brixworth. Notably, the development over the year led to a memorable one-two finish at the São Paulo Grand Prix. The progress throughout 2022 excites Technical Director, Mike Elliott.
“Last year, once we had figured out what we needed to do, it took a huge amount of work to get ourselves moving forward. Towards the end of the season, you could see the performance improving and the winter has been a reset. We have done all the things that we wanted to do with the W13 last year but weren’t able to because of resource constraints or because our focus was elsewhere fixing other issues,” he said.
Areas targeted include reducing overall weight, giving the drivers a more consistent car balance across the speed range, and better matching the aerodynamic characteristics to the demands of the aero regulations. This is borne out in areas such as a significantly lighter chassis, revised front suspension geometry, cooling system adjustments and a refined aerodynamic concept based on last year’s learning.
“With this generation of cars, the performance is all in the detail. When you look at the W14, you will see the DNA of the W13 but also a lot of evolution and detail improvement,” Elliott added.
“Our colours going forward will be silver and black.” So said Toto at the launch of last year’s car and for 2023, the Team returns to the latter in the name of performance. Hitting the weight limit is a significant challenge with this generation of cars, and the Team has taken inspiration from the legendary creation of the original Silver Arrows. However, instead of stripping back paint to shiny aluminium beneath, it will be sleek black carbon fibre on the W14.
“We were overweight last year. This year we have tried to figure out where we can squeeze out every single gram. So now, history repeats itself. You will see that the car has some raw carbon bits, along with some that are painted matte black. Of course, when we changed the livery in 2020 the main driving factor was to support the diversity and equality causes which are always close to our heart. The colour black became part of our DNA at that point, so we are pleased to return to it,” Toto commented.
The historical links don’t end there, however, with the black livery also echoing the 1993 Sauber C12. That car utilised ‘Concept by Mercedes’ power and signalled the three-pointed star’s return to the pinnacle of motorsport for the first time since 1955.
30 years on from the creation of the Brixworth-built engine that saw Mercedes re-join Grand Prix racing, the factory in Northamptonshire is once again a hive of activity. With the Power Unit hardware freeze in effect, focus has shifted to two key areas: reliability and software.
“It’s the busiest time of year,” said Hywel Thomas, Managing Director of Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains (HPP). “We’ve got the final performance software freeze of this regulation cycle ahead of the start of the season so that’s been a lot of work. We have found the most performance recently through the way we use the engine and that means software upgrades. Knowing that it is the final opportunity for development has ensured it’s been a real push to pack in as much work as possible.”
The challenges presented by the W13 weren’t limited to the chassis, either. The effect of the bouncing on the Power Unit was of concern, and reliability fixes have been implemented. “By the end of the season, the engines were battered and bruised,” Hywel continued. “We have looked at the design changes made on the chassis, along with those on the engine, and done the work as a team. The biggest changes on the Power Unit this year are the reliability items to make ourselves more robust if we find the car hitting the ground.”
The Mercedes-AMG F1 W14 E PERFORMANCE was unveiled at Silverstone, the home of British motorsport earlier today. Helping launch our car were members of our latest cohort of Team apprentices, and PETRONAS interns. The Team’s commitment to building a more diverse workforce remains a significant priority. Our apprenticeship and intern schemes, along with Accelerate 25, have aided significant progress in this area. But there is still more work to be done.
“It’s fantastic to have some of our 2023 apprentices and PETRONAS interns help us launch this year’s car. It is a reminder of the Team we aspire to become. Our commitment to becoming a more diverse and performant organisation is unwavering and we are pleased with the steps we have made,” Toto said.
The Accelerate 25 programme formalises our ambition of at least 25% of all new team members coming from under-represented groups. Since launching two years ago, our percentage of female employees has risen from 12% to 16% with team members from a minority ethnic background growing to 9% from 3%, as of January 2023.
“These numbers are positive developments and we aspire to more. Two years on from the launch of Accelerate 25, now is the right time to reflect; we can be pleased with the progress we have made and need to be clear how we move forward. Our focus is not just about recruitment, though; it is also about retaining and developing our diverse talent. We will continue pushing to achieve our aims in this area,” Toto said.
Reliability, correlation, and learning will be the focus when it comes to pre-season testing in Bahrain. With just three days of running before the first race weekend of the season, an efficient and successful test is imperative.
“We never really got on top of the car balance last year. All the normal work we do at the beginning of the season didn’t happen because of the problems we were trying to rectify,” Mike commented. “We’ve got to learn as much as we can, to work out how to get the most performance out of the car and what we can learn to feed into the next developments.”
“The chassis side have got an enormous amount of work that they want to complete to learn,” added Hywel. “We need to be in the background doing our job and helping rack up the mileage.”
That symbiotic relationship between Brackley and Brixworth was crucial to the team’s progress last year. “We worked together, worked out how we can take what we have got on both sides and improved in all areas. It’s exciting to see what the result of that continued closeness is this year.”
Toto added: “The entire organisation was pushing flat out last year. When we realised that the car wasn’t where we wanted it to be, we mobilised every reserve we had. That never stopped throughout the season. We are now getting ready to start the next season. I see so much effort, motivation, and energy in the organisation to launch a car that will eventually be competitive enough to fight at the very front of the grid.”
That energy is something that inspires both Lewis and George. “I have been a part of this team for over a decade and the efforts of everyone never cease to amaze me,” Lewis commented. “I find it inspiring how diligently and passionately each person approaches their work.”
George added: “I have been incredibly impressed with how the Team developed the car throughout last season. We have been building momentum throughout 2022 and we’re excited to see how that has progressed over the winter.”
And what about their initial thoughts on the W14? George continued: “Aesthetically it looks great! It’s bold, aggressive and stands out.” Lewis added: “To see the evolution of the car and the changes that have been made is fascinating.  We’ve redesigned, optimised, and innovated so many parts of the car and that is impressive. And I love the new livery! It says, ‘we mean business’.”
Last season brought George’s maiden pole position and Grand Prix victory. He is eyeing further successes this year and raring to go. “It’s been a long winter and there’s plenty of anticipation to see if the W14 lives up to our expectations. I’m excited and, while there’s a lot of talk at this point in the season, we now need to see how we perform when the car takes to the track.”
For Lewis, the motivation within burns bright as he looks to come back from the first winless season in his career. “I’m excited to go racing again. I feel calm, energised, and have my focus sharpened. I’m ready to do what’s necessary to win.”
Lewis and George begin their second season together as team-mates but there’s a change in Reserve Driver for 2023. Mick Schumacher joins the Team after two years spent as a race driver at the Haas F1 Team. The 23-year-old German said: “I’ve always felt very close to Mercedes. I am very happy to be a part of the Team and I know how important my role will be in aiding the development of the W14. I am committed to giving it my all to contribute to our performance in this competitive environment.”
The growth of the sport continues apace; a race in Las Vegas, the third of three Grands Prix in the United States this season, record-breaking attendance figures, and a new season of Drive to Survive launching shortly. “Formula One is going from strength to strength around the globe. I think it is doing so because we are providing good content. Proper racing, interesting personalities, and the odd controversy on and off the track,” Toto said.
That boom in interest has been mirrored in the continued strength and expansion of our partner ecosystem, and the team is now one of the leading global sports franchises in terms of commercial revenue.
The renewal of our Title and Technical Partnership with PETRONAS from the 2026 season onwards was announced late last year, sending a clear message. “Our Team and PETRONAS are no longer just partners, we are family, and we will be one team for many more years to come. We are excited to be racing into the future alongside PETRONAS, with the ambition to set the standard once again, in our on-track performance and by pioneering the transition of a global sports team to a net-zero future.”
Today, we announce the latest innovators to join our partner family. US multinational Qualcomm Technologies has agreed a multi-year agreement with the Team to promote its Snapdragon brand. The strategic collaboration will leverage the power of the Snapdragon platform for the benefit of the Team and our global fanbase. We also welcome Abu Dhabi-based technology group G42, which champions artificial intelligence (AI) as a powerful force for good to enhance and improve people’s abilities and lives.
They are the latest global players to begin partnerships with the Team ahead of the 2023 season following four recently announced deals. Solera, the global leader in vehicle lifecycle management and payments technology company Nuvei, have both agreed multi-year partnerships. Einhell, a leading manufacturer of state-of-the-art cordless power tools and garden equipment, becomes the Team’s ‘Official Tool Expert’. Sherwin-Williams meanwhile joins as the approved supplier of automotive paint and coatings to the Team’s F1 cars.
Richard Sanders, Chief Commercial Officer of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team, said: “The growth of F1 globally is reflected in the ever-increasing interest from world-class brands and innovative companies to join our partner ecosystem. We’re proud to be adding to the excitement of launch day by welcoming both Snapdragon and G42. They join several other fantastic brands that we have partnered with ahead of the 2023 season and we look forward to working closely with them, and our long-standing partners, throughout the year.”"
Red Bull Racing RB19 RBPT Honda,"Red Bull Racing did the best job following extensive regulations changes ahead of the 2022 season. With defending World Champion Max Verstappen at the helm, the RB18 absolutely dominated and the driver and team secured the World Championship early. For 2023, the design was further refined to form the RB19.
While the regulations remained mostly the same compared to 2022, there were detail changes setting a minimum ride height and mirror size. These modifications were carried through as part of the upgrade to the RB19. Further work concentrated on the side-pod design, which proved crucial to make the RB18 work so well in 2022. The ground-effect floor and its edges were also refined.
The RB19 was again powered by the Honda-inspired Red Bull Powertrains built power unit. The Japanese manufacturer upped their involvement and the hybrid V6 engine is now referred to as a RBPT Honda. The RB19 livery was revealed in New York and at the same event, a new partnership was announced with Ford, so from 2026 onwards the cars will be powered by RBPT Ford power units.
The world got a first glimpse of the RB19 during the single, three-day pre-season test at Bahrain. Max Verstappen racked up a startling 157 laps on the opening day and also set the fastest time."
Williams FW45 Mercedes,"Williams Racing is proud to reveal the livery that will adorn the FW45, the team’s new challenger for the 2023 FIA Formula One World Championship season. Williams Racing is also thrilled to showcase major partners, with Gulf Oil, Stephens, Michelob ULTRA and PureStream joining the team from the 2023 season.
The 2023 livery design is an evolution of the FW44, retaining the brand visual cues which features a contrasting diamond shape and flashes of red and blue, embodying the exciting new era of Williams Racing. This year's design features a colour finish change to matte, providing a stronger on track visual.
The FW45, which will be rolled out on 13th February, is an evolution of the FW44.The floor edges have been raised to satisfy the updated 2023 FIA Technical Regulations and the team has taken the opportunity to heavily evolve the sidepod concept, which has been made possible by optimising the power unit cooling layout. There are also modifications to the front suspension layout as well as the major external aerodynamic surfaces. As a result, the FW45 is more aerodynamically efficient than the FW44, with more overall downforce and improved handling characteristics. The 2023 Pirelli tyres are an evolution of the 2022 version and the FW45 is optimised to the improved characteristics of the new tyres.
Gulf Oil International’s partnership with Williams Racing is a significant signing as the team continues its transformative journey and demonstrates the new era of commercial strength at the team since its acquisition by Dorilton Capital.
A further major partnership is confirmed from this season with Stephens as Official Investment Banking Partner, an independent financial services firm founded in the United States in 1933, with key offices in the US, London and Frankfurt. Williams Racing and Stephens will partner in a strategic marketing alliance as Stephens’ increases its footprint in Europe.
Michelob ULTRA, the fastest growing beer brand in the United States, joins the team in a multi-year partnership which unites two iconic brands with a long history of excellence and recognition. As a part of the Anheuser-Busch portfolio, Michelob ULTRA reunites the leading brewer with Williams Racing and Formula 1 for the first time since 2006. Through this partnership, Michelob ULTRA and Williams Racing will bring premium experiences for fans to enjoy at the Grand Prix throughout North America, reminding fans “it’s only worth it if you enjoy it.”
Williams Racing and PureStream have partnered to lead an exchange of best practices between leading electronic trading teams and the F1 team. Both electronic trading and motorsport rely on many functionally-organised teams working together with new technology, balancing precision measurements and subjective strategies to win under hyper-competitive and split-second conditions. PureStream will co-host thought leadership events at select F1 races throughout 2023 to enable the exchange of ideas between Williams Racing and leading electronic trading teams.
For 2023 Williams Racing has an exciting driver line-up, with Alex Albon beginning his second year with the team, after an impressive season in 2022, scoring points in multiple races. American driver Logan Sargeant joins as Alex’s team-mate, after climbing the ranks from the Williams Racing Driver Academy. The 22-year-old will make his F1 debut at the upcoming Bahrain Grand Prix.
The FW45 will hit the track at Silverstone on 13th February, with both race drivers, Alex Albon and Logan Sargeant, undertaking driving duties. Williams Racing Brand Ambassador and 2009 F1 World Champion Jenson Button will also be in attendance to see this year’s car complete its first laps.
As Williams Racing continues its transformative new chapter, it welcomes James Vowles as Team Principal. James joins on 20th February from Mercedes F1 Team, bringing a wealth of experience and strategic capabilities that will lead the team and help push Williams Racing both on and off-track.
Matthew Savage, Chairman of the Board, Williams Racing: As Williams Racing continues its transformation, we’re proud to unveil this year’s livery. We are excited about this year’s car, and I cannot thank the entire team at Grove enough for their hard work to get ready for the season. I am delighted to welcome both new and existing partners to our journey. With our new Team Principal James Vowles joining us later this month, as well as our exciting driver line up of Alex and Logan, Williams Racing will be giving its all in 2023.
Alex Albon: I’m really excited to be starting back for another year with the team. The car looks great and will hit the track at Silverstone. The team has worked really hard last year and over the winter to address some key areas in our car, putting in the work to try and maximise what we get out of the car for 2023, so I’m looking forward to seeing what the FW45 can do. We also welcome new partners to the team this year, so it’s great to have them onboard.
Logan Sargeant: I’m really excited for the season to get started after what, for me, feels like a long winter! I’m super motivated and we’ve put a lot of hard work in. The car is looking amazing and it shows the huge effort the team has put in the off season, so I’m looking forward to getting started at Silverstone before heading out to Bahrain."
Alfa Romeo Racing C42 Ferrari,"The C42 is here, in its full glory. The latest Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN contender was finally unveiled, in an eye-catching livery of red and white, completing the grid for what promises to be an incredible season of Formula One racing.
After a busy week of testing in Barcelona, the C42 – which had been running in a special camouflage livery in Spain – was unveiled via a series of CGI images and videos released simultaneously to media and fans all over the world. The C42 was also displayed in real time in the living rooms, classrooms and kitchens of millions of supporters worldwide through Augmented Reality, via the use of a special QR code promoted on merchandise and online.
The Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN C42 is the first car produced in Hinwil under the budget cap regulations and for the new era of Formula One starting in 2022. Designed by a team led by Technical Director, Jan Monchaux, this car is a radical departure from the past as it embraces the possibilities dictated by the new ground-effect floor, updated aerodynamic package and 18-inch, low profile tyres. The C42, powered by a new Ferrari engine, is a racing machine designed to battle, as the new regulations will allow closer racing and competitive fighting from the front to the rear of the grid.
The livery, a product designed and developed by Alfa Romeo’s famous Centro Stile, is a stunning yet subtle nod to the past, recalling historical designs of years past and the heritage of Alfa Romeo and Sauber Motorsport, in the Hinwil team’s 30th year in Formula One. Title partners, Alfa Romeo and ORLEN, feature prominently, and the car is adorned with the branding of the many partners, returning and new, joining the team – a clear display of the growing appeal the team has for companies.
In the hands of 10-times race winner, Valtteri Bottas, and Zhou Guanyu, the first F1 driver from China and the only rookie on the grid in 2022, the C42 is ready to impress.
Frédéric Vasseur, Team Principal of Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN: ""The start of the season is always an exciting time, one in which we see the fruit of the work of hundreds of people over a long period of time. The C42 is a car we look forward to seeing racing, not just because it is the first we built in this new regulations cycle, one in which racing should be closer and more thrilling, but because we have the utmost confidence in this car helping the team make a big step forward towards the front of the grid.”
Jan Monchaux, Technical Director of Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN: “As we unveil the C42, it may feel like the start of a new season: we know, however, that this launch is just a milestone in a much longer journey in which our whole staff in Hinwil has invested so much time, resource and energies. Designing and building this car has been a huge undertaking and we can be proud of what we have achieved, but our work is not finished. As always in a new rules cycle, the development curve will be at its steepest this season and we need to continue extracting new performance out of the C42 to make the progress we have set as an objective for ourselves.”
Valtteri Bottas, Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN driver: “I am impressed by our new car, the C42. I think the livery is really beautiful, the Alfa Romeo Centro Stile did a brilliant job. It’s my first car at Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN, of course, which makes it special, and I am really looking forward to being on the grid in Bahrain with it. What is exciting is that we have no idea how that first race is going to pan out. Testing helped us confirm our expectations of where we stand, the progress we have made with the car, but now we are getting closer to the moment that really matters. Since I joined, I have seen so much motivation within this team: everyone is pushing a lot, trying to work harder than the others to be competitive, and that in turn gives me that extra boost when I am in the cockpit.”
Zhou Guanyu, Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN driver: “I am fully pumped up for the season and seeing the C42 in the livery in which I will race it definitely makes it real. We are at the beginning of a new era, with new cars and new regulations, and this creates an opportunity for all teams to make progress since we are all starting from scratch. Everyone at Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN has been incredibly helpful since I joined and seeing all the hard work, the commitment and motivation from everyone, in Hinwil and at the track, fills me with pride and excitement. I can’t wait to be on the grid with this car and work with my team to bring home the results we are targeting together.”
Robert Kubica, Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN reserve driver: “The start of a new season is always a time where expectations, hopes and plans come together: this year, the stakes are even higher as we are taking a bit of a jump into the unknown with the new regulations. There has been an incredible amount of work that went into this car, the C42, and I am looking forward to seeing what the team can achieve with it. In my role, I am aiming to provide as much help as possible in the development of this car: we know how big the margins of improvement are at this stage in the lifetime of a car and we know that each upgrade can make a difference, so the work we do back at base is going to be crucial to deliver results trackside.”"
AlphaTauri AT03,"Scuderia AlphaTauri revealed its 2022 challenger – the AT03 – alongside its drivers, Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda, in an innovative digital launch, which merges the virtual and real worlds in a pioneering video production, to kick off the new season in style.
The Italian-based team, in collaboration with Red Bull’s premium fashion brand AlphaTauri, has created a first-of-its-kind launch video by combining a 3D CGI rendering of the race car and its surroundings with real footage of the AlphaTauri Spring/Summer 2022 collection runway show, highlighting the fusion of tech, innovation and style, that bonds the two companies together.
The actual AT03 will make its first official F1 appearance at next week’s Barcelona test, but in the meantime the innovative video tells the story of the synergies between fashion and motorsport through three main pillars. It starts with a Monolith in the CGI world, representing the team’s technology, state-of-the-art facilities, and know-how of the people who have produced the car. Each element then moves towards the second pillar, the Portal – signifying AlphaTauri and its technology – that ‘dresses’ the AT03, drivers and models, as they move into the real world, the World of AlphaTauri. This final pillar demonstrates the product of the partnership, where the ‘Style Of A New Era’ materialises across both fashion and F1.
Following the team’s highest points scoring season to date – picking up 142 points in 2021 – Scuderia AlphaTauri has embraced the new Formula 1 regulations with the AT03, styled in an updated blue and white livery. Continuity is still key during this new era of F1, therefore the team has retained the ultra-competitive duo of, Pierre and Yuki, for the upcoming season. Pierre’s experience makes him the natural team leader, while teammate Yuki continues his F1 journey in what will be his second season in the sport.
Pierre Gasly said: “This year sees a huge change to the car as, due to the new regulations, the look and design is completely different, so the team has had to start from a clean sheet of paper. We won’t know the true performance of the AT03 until we get it out on track at pre-season testing in Barcelona but so far, I think it looks great and I am very excited to get this new season started!”
“It really does look great.” Yuki Tsunoda confirmed, “Of course we’ve not seen the real car on track yet, but the new shape and design are really cool, and I think the livery suits it really well and I hope everyone enjoys the launch video.”
Franz Tost, Scuderia AlphaTauri Team Principal, said: “I am excited to finally reveal what our 2022 Formula 1 car will look like. It is a completely new era for F1 and we hope that this package will be very strong, following last year’s success. Once again, we have worked closely with AlphaTauri to launch our new car and I think we’ve managed to deliver something very special.”
Ahmet Mercan, CEO AlphaTauri, said: “We are excited about new beginnings this season and have explored a lot of interesting opportunities to add style aspects to F1. For Scuderia AlphaTauri, it is a new era in Formula 1, and for AlphaTauri it is a new era in style.”"
Alpine A522 Renault,"BWT Alpine F1 Team officially welcomed its new A522 to the world today in Paris, ushering in a new era of Alpine excellence and sporting prowess ahead of the much anticipated 2022 FIA Formula 1 World Championship. The A522 keeps its striking Alpine blue livery, coupled this year with the iconic pink colours of BWT, the team’s recently announced title partner for 2022. BWT Alpine F1 Team also presented a ‘flipped’ livery with pink becoming the most prominent colour. This unique livery will be used for the first two races of the season, highlighting the new partnership with title partner BWT.
The presentation of BWT Alpine F1 Team’s second ever Formula 1 car was led by Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi, CEO Renault Group, Luca de Meo, as well as newly appointed Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer. Drivers Esteban Ocon and Fernando Alonso were also on hand to reveal the much anticipated A522 to the world. This new-look team will target further progression in 2022, after Alpine impressed in its debut campaign in Formula 1 last year.
The technical teams at Enstone will continue to be led by the recently promoted and experienced duo of Pat Fry, Chief Technical Officer, and Matt Harman, the new team’s Technical Director. Across the channel in Viry-Châtillon, the team has recently appointed Bruno Famin as Executive Director of Alpine Racing, tasked with maximising engine performance and integration into the chassis.
Staff in both factories have worked non-stop for the past 18 months to create the A522 against the backdrop of sweeping regulation changes introduced for the 2022 campaign. The collaboration between the two bases has been key in bringing the A522 to life. Alongside a completely new chassis and car build, the team is proud to showcase its all-new RE22 power unit, marking yet another chapter in the French car manufacturer’s illustrious heritage in Formula 1. The engine specification and packaging has allowed the team some extra freedom in shaping the rest of the car to better exploit the latest technical regulations and adjust for the new fuel specification, E10, as the next step to sustainable fuels in Formula 1.
BWT Alpine F1 Team continues with the same driver line-up a second season. Esteban – now a race winner in Formula 1 – enters his third year in a row powered by a Renault engine, while Fernando embarks on a historic and potentially record breaking twentieth season in Formula 1. Oscar Piastri is the team’s official Reserve Driver for 2022 after graduating from the Alpine Academy last year. The Australian driver is fresh from winning the 2021 FIA Formula 2 Drivers’ Championship.
Esteban and Fernando will take the reins of the A522 at the team’s filming day tomorrow at the Circuit de Catalunya, before embarking on pre-season testing later in the week.
Laurent Rossi, CEO, Alpine: “It’s with great pleasure that we launch our A522 to the world today, marking the next chapter in Alpine’s Formula 1 journey. We are proud racers and have poured the essence of Alpine’s racing heritage and passion into this new generation of car. We have a clear plan and vision in place at Alpine and we have some of the best people in the business to help drive us forward and realise our ambitions. Our team is stronger now and, we hope, future-proof. Our driver line-up is the perfect recipe to help deliver the results we want to achieve on track. In 2022, we want to show constant progress with comprehensive developments across all sites to ensure we are contenders for the title in the future. We are going in the right direction and we want to carry on our climb to the summit.”
Esteban Ocon, BWT Alpine F1 Team driver: “I’m very excited, of course, to not only see the A522 for the first time but to drive it for the first time this week. It’s always a privilege to drive a new Formula 1 car for the first time as you know all the hard work that has gone on behind the scenes at both factories in Enstone and Viry from all of the many talented people working in the different departments there. That feeling and responsibility is truly unique and very special. I feel prepared, I feel ready physically, so let’s hit the track and see what we’ve got in our hands this year!”
Fernando Alonso, BWT Alpine F1 Team driver: “It’s good to be back and I’ve been working hard to be ready for the new season. The build-up has been a long time coming after the rule change was delayed due to the pandemic. The car looks fantastic with the new regulations in place and I like the new livery. We have a new engine and we’re confident we had a good development in place for this new generation of car. We won’t know where everyone stands until Bahrain, but we’re excited to take the car for its first spin in testing this week. I hope the new regulations have worked and we get more exciting wheel to wheel racing this year.”"
Aston Martin AMR22 Mercedes,"The latest Aston Martin Formula One car, the AMR22, broke cover today in a special launch event held at the global headquarters of Aston Martin Lagonda at Gaydon, UK.
The AMR22 car was revealed on the factory production line, led by the team’s drivers Lance Stroll and Sebastian Vettel. Also in attendance was Executive Chairman, Lawrence Stroll, alongside Chief Technical Officer, Andrew Green, and Performance Director, Tom McCullough.
The AMR22 includes a radical aerodynamic design philosophy as prescribed by the new technical rules designed to deliver more competitive racing. An updated car livery adds further aggression with lime details blended across a refined version of the traditional green livery.
Aramco logos are incorporated into the livery to mark the beginning of a strategic long-term partnership, while branding from title partner, Cognizant, appears on the sidepods, chassis top, front wing and rear wing. Prominent logos from Peroni Nastro Azzurro 0.0%, Crypto.com, SentinelOne and JCB also feature across the AMR22.
Speaking at the launch event, Executive Chairman, Lawrence Stroll, said: “The Aston Clinton hill climb is about an hour's drive from Gaydon and it was there that Lionel Martin launched Aston Martin into the heat of competition. That was the start of the climb that our Formula One team is still on today. We have a five-year plan to keep climbing and get to the top.
“To win in Formula One everything has to be in the right place and a lot of moving parts have to come together. You need the right people in every part of the team and you need the right partners to help make that possible. At Aston Martin we have wonderful and highly valued partners, including our title partner, Cognizant, and I am delighted to welcome Aramco as our long-term strategic partner.”
Speaking after the unveiling, Sebastian Vettel said: “Look at that car, who wouldn't feel excited about the prospect of racing that? And when it comes to hopes for the season, I do not think anyone really knows what to expect. There are new rules and of course all the teams will be hoping that they have got it right. Everyone wants to win, me included, and no one would be in Formula One if their dream was not to win. I am no different. The main thing is to keep moving forward and moving up. This is only year two of a five-year plan, so we are still quite near the start. But this team has big ambitions and big plans, and I am hugely excited to be a part of that.”
Team-mate Lance Stroll added: “This is not only a big opportunity for Aston Martin, but also for all the teams. We just have to believe that we have done a better job and I know that everyone involved is working unbelievably hard to give Seb and me the best chance. At the same time, we have to be realistic heading into the new season. Our main aim is to move nearer the front than we were last year. That would be progress. As Seb said, it is impossible to know where every team will be until we all get on track, and even then you might not know who has really got it right until qualifying in Bahrain. Aston Martin has some really clever people so I am optimistic we can make good progress this year.”
Speaking about the AMR22 and the season ahead, Andrew Green, Chief Technical Officer, said: “The 2022 regulations are like no other that have gone before: a radical change of direction in both concept and application, probably the most significant change of chassis regulations ever implemented, with an incredibly small amount of carry-over from 2021 into 2022. As a direct result of that, the past winter has undoubtedly been the toughest we have ever had. But with new regulations come new challenges and new opportunities.
“No one has all the answers to maximising the new regulations, so it is all about avoiding development cul-de-sacs, and that was the key message to our design team. It is a huge challenge, but everyone has risen to the task, and we are motivated to solve the many questions that have and continue to arise during the development process. All that while operating under the new cost cap regulations and more restrictive aerodynamic development restrictions.
“The AMR22 we see is our ‘first’ iteration under these new regulations. It will evolve dramatically over the coming months as we run the cars for real and begin to understand the challenges involved. That will, in turn, forge the direction for 2023 and beyond.”
Tom McCullough, Performance Director, added: “All the teams and all the drivers will be addressing a new set of regulations, so having the ability to learn and adapt will be crucial. It throws something new into the mix and we will be generating vast amounts of critical data when the new cars, fitted with 18-inch tyres, take to the track for the first time. How we deal with that will be a test of where we are as an organisation. The new rules mean that everyone will be starting with a relatively clean sheet of paper. You have to suspect that those teams that have been winning recently will start as favourites, but if any team gets a handle on something vital before the rest that could make a crucial difference. I have no doubt that we at Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Formula One™ Team are in position, on and off track, to take advantage of any opportunity that comes our way.”"
Ferrari F1-75,"The Scuderia Ferrari had a dismal couple of seasons after a clarification of the regulations forced the Italian team to peg the engine back towards the end of 2019. The extensive regulation changes that came into effect at the start of 2022 offered Ferrari a unique opportunity to claw back the deficit to the Red Bull Racing and Mercedes-AMG F1. By prioritising the development of the 2022 car, Ferrari gained a head start of its rivals.
Dubbed the F1-75 to mark the celebration of Ferrari's 75th anniversary, the new-for-2022 car started with a fresh design. The extensive regulation changes focused on simplified aerodynamics with the addition of ground-effect tunnels to allow cars to run more closely together and ultimately aid overtaking. With barge-boards banned, much of the development work focused on the side-pods. The ones on the F1-75 featured high intakes and concave top surfaces. The low nose was reminiscent of early 1990s Grand Prix cars.
What was carried over from the earlier cars was the sophisticated hybrid power unit. As per the regulations, the drivetrain consisted of a turbocharged V6 internal combustion engine with hybrid systems harvesting kinetic engine from braking and the turbocharger. The power was transferred to the rear wheels through an eight-speed gearbox, actuated by paddles behind the steering wheel. During the 2020 and 2021 seasons, Ferrari had gradually made up the ground lost. This was very timely as the new regulations include a freeze in engine development through to the end of 2024.
As in 2021, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr. were signed to drive for Scuderia Ferrari. During the pre-season testing, the F1-75s were immediately on the pace and proved reliable. This form was carried over for the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. Leclerc and Sainz qualified first and third, and then scored a one-two victory. In doing so, Leclerc ended Ferrari's 45-Grand Prix victory drought."
Haas VF-22 Ferrari,"With 2022 finally seeing a new set of regulations dramatically changing the way Formula 1 cars look, and race, coming into play – Uralkali Haas F1 Team today unveiled the design and livery of its brand-new VF-22 challenger.
Revealed across the team’s social media channels, the series of digital renders released on Friday showcase the car that Uralkali Haas F1 Team drivers Nikita Mazepin and Mick Schumacher will compete with across the record-breaking 23-race 2022 FIA Formula 1 World Championship.
The VF-22 is the first entry to emerge from the American-owned team’s all-new design-office in Maranello, Italy – led by Technical Director Simone Resta. Bringing together a new personnel group and weaving it into the existing fabric of the team, now entering its seventh season in Formula 1, was just one of many challenges tackled through 2021 culminating in the design of the VF-22 – a car which has its genesis in a completely new set of regulations.
With the 2022 regulations designed to promote closer racing, and therefore more overtaking and excitement, the aerodynamics of the VF-22 are strikingly different to anything seen previously. New items have been incorporated to achieve the goal of the regulations such as a ground-effect floor, simplified front-wing, and a dramatic shaped rear-wing. Another striking new addition is the introduction of Pirelli’s 18-inch wheelrims and low-profile tires – designed to reduce overheating and allow drivers to push more on each stint. The VF-22 will be powered by the Ferrari 066/7 turbocharged 1.6-liter V6 power-unit running on fuel containing a 10% bio-component ratio achieved through a move to ‘E10’ fuel.
While the design of the VF-22 is dramatically different, the livery of the new entry is an evolution of last year’s predominantly white design which coincided with the arrival of title partner Uralkali – one of the world’s largest potash fertilizer producers and exporters. Haas Automation maintains its branding presence on the VF-22, the global CNC machine tool company founded by team owner Gene Haas. A burgeoning partner portfolio is further incorporated into the livery with on-car branding supported by 1&1, IONOS, Tricorp, Under Armour and CYRUS Genève, while Taittinger and Maui Jim continue to feature on a variety of key team assets.
On the launch of the VF-22 Gene Haas, Founder of Haas Automation and Chairman of Uralkali Haas F1 Team commented; “It’s that time of year where you’re naturally optimistic that the hard work and effort of everyone will translate to a competitive entry on track. We made the decision back in 2020 to really channel time and resources into the VF-22, foregoing anything track-related for 2021 – which wasn’t easy to watch. Hopefully that decision bears fruit and we return to challenging for points and taking something from the weekends.”
“It’s exciting to be at the point where we know the VF-22 will be on-track shortly,” said Guenther Steiner, Team Principal – Uralkali Haas F1 Team. “We all know what the team is capable of, we’ve proved that in the past, and with this new car – born out of a completely new set of regulations and with our new design team in place, I’m confident we can showcase once again that we can compete on weekends. It’s been a tremendous effort by everyone involved and now comes the fun part of getting the new car to the circuit and dialing in all the elements. Last season was a long one but I’m confident that 2022 will see us back in the mix with the VF-22.”
“This is probably the most complex project the Uralkali Haas F1 Team has dealt with to-date for many reasons,” reflected Simone Resta, Technical Director – Uralkali Haas F1 Team. “It’s a completely new set of regulations and this season we’ve brought in a new team to manage the creation of the VF-22. Not everyone is new but a good chunk of people have joined with a revised structure now in place. I consider this as a great success in the process. We’re still early in the project and going through a transitional season of working together on a car for a full year, but if we look back where we started, this team is already a success.”
All 10 Formula 1 teams will gather to shakedown their new entries at Spain’s Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya February 23-25. Pre-season testing then moves to the Bahrain International Circuit from March 10-12. The 2022 FIA Formula 1 World Championship launches with the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix March 20."
McLaren MCL36 Mercedes,"McLaren Racing unveiled its new MCL36 to a live global audience ahead of the 2022 FIA Formula 1 World Championship. To be piloted by Lando Norris, 22, from the UK, and Daniel Ricciardo, 32, from Australia, the MCL36 is built to the new era of Formula 1 regulations, which aim to provide closer racing and more on-track action for fans.
Lando Norris enters his fourth season in Formula 1 with McLaren and looks to build on an exceptional 2021 season during which he achieved four podium finishes and claimed his first pole position. McLaren’s most recent race winner Daniel Ricciardo enters his 12th season in Formula 1, and his second with McLaren.
Over the course of the 2021 season, McLaren made significant progress on its journey back to the top of the sport, including securing the team’s first win since 2012, and the only 1-2 finish of the 2021 season at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza. In addition, the team further closed the gap to the top teams, securing their greatest number of world championship points since 2012.
The MCL36 was revealed at the crescendo of the McLaren Racing 2022 launch, alongside the team’s INDYCAR and Extreme E contenders, each sporting common livery colourways, galvanising the McLaren Racing family ahead of their respective campaigns.
Designed under the leadership of Technical Director James Key and produced by the team in Woking, led by Operations Director Piers Thynne, the MCL36 features several striking and dramatic changes compared to the MCL35M. The return of ground-effect to Formula 1 changes the fundamental philosophy of the car and is part of new regulations aimed at improving racing by reducing the amount of disrupted airflow generated by the cars. The MCL36 is powered by the Mercedes-AMG F1 M13 E Performance which was integrated into the McLaren chassis and gearbox with support from Mercedes HPP in Brixworth, UK.
The colours first carried by the team in the 1960s with team founder Bruce McLaren are retained for the 2022 season, with fan favourite Papaya continuing to lead the livery. Having debuted on the MCL35M’s Monaco livery in 2021 to fan acclaim, the bold Fluro Papaya is now featured on the MCL36 for the 2022 season, accented by New Blue.
Lando, Daniel and the team will take the MCL36 to the track at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, during the first of two pre-season tests ahead of the opening race of the season at the 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix on 20 March."
Mercedes-AMG W13 E Performance,"As dawn breaks on a brand-new era for Formula One, the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team today launched its challenger for the 2022 season – the Mercedes-AMG F1 W13 E Performance. With the sport’s most significant technical regulation change in a generation, the factories at Brackley and Brixworth have been bristling with activity to respond to the challenge and identify every possible opportunity to unlock performance.
After 18 months of hard work, the end result is the W13, a car which is 98% new and freshly designed from tip-to-toe with minimal carry-over from its predecessor. Behind the wheel of the W13 for the 2022 season will be a new driver partnership of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell, who graduates from the Mercedes Young Driver Programme to step up to the eight-time world champion Mercedes-AMG works team.
“Ever since work on W13 began, I have seen an excited enthusiasm in our team members like never before, thanks to the scale of opportunity that these technical regulations provide,” said Toto Wolff, Team Principal & CEO of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team. “Towards the end of the year when the car build project truly came together, I felt a deep passion across the whole organisation, not only in the technical arena but across our bases at Brackley and Brixworth who were embracing a mindset of 'we can do this'”.
“We did pretty well during the last big regulatory change into the hybrid era and performed well when we went from the narrow to the wide cars in 2017. While we have a good track record, my message is clear: we can't rely on past success for this year's performance, but we can rely on our people, our culture, our structure, and our mindset to do the best possible job for 2022”, continued Toto.
The team’s 2022 challenger will be named the ‘Mercedes-AMG F1 W13 E Performance’, with W13 representing the thirteenth car produced by the Mercedes-AMG works team since re-entering F1 in 2010. The ‘E Performance’ technology label signifies the continued close collaboration between the team and Mercedes-AMG, with the label featuring on all new AMG performance hybrid cars.
The technical regulation changes for 2022, whose introduction was delayed by a year as F1 negotiated the COVID-19 pandemic, represent a fundamental shift in design rules and one of the biggest regulatory changes the sport has ever seen.
“On the chassis side, the changes are huge,” said Mike Elliott, the team’s Technical Director. “We haven’t had a change as big as this one in my career. I think there are three aspects to this: first, the way the regulations are constructed is very different, particularly for aerodynamics, and that has a big impact. Second, what they are trying to achieve with the aerodynamics means the cars are fundamentally a different shape. Third, this is the first time we will have attempted such a big change under a cost cap.”
The W13 is the product of a complete redesign from top to bottom, with the steering wheel the only carryover element from its predecessor. Operating with a blank slate and such a steep development curve has been a stimulating experience for the engineers at the team’s Brackley base and something they’ve relished.
“Engineers love a challenge and therefore it is a fantastic opportunity to do something fresh. In the aerodynamic world, normally you are chasing after little bits and pieces, but with such big regulation changes, the gains have been coming in big chunks which is quite satisfying,” Mike explained. “On the flipside, we’ve had a period of success, winning the last eight Constructors’ titles and this is a reset. All the teams have started from scratch with the model provided by F1 and you don’t get to carry over the benefits or fix the issues from last year’s car, so everyone began this journey at the same level.”
However, the Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions introduced in 2021 - aimed at levelling the playing field - mean teams have had varying amounts of development opportunity at their disposal, with aerodynamic testing allocated on a sliding scale based on a team’s finishing position in the 2021 Constructors’ Championship.
“The teams have started with different allocations of runs in the wind tunnel and hours of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) so it has the potential to really mix up the order,” Mike adds. “That’s an exciting test as an engineer but there is obviously some risk in there too, in terms of our competitive position.”
Under previous technical regulations, the component detail on the cars was far greater and small pieces of aero furniture, working in unison, contributed a large amount of aerodynamic performance. For 2022, teams will find performance gains in more fundamental shape changes and bigger components than in previous years.
“Getting to the desired aero shapes has meant a complete internal repackaging, right down to the electrical layout and where we fit things like the ECU. The suspension has been redesigned to account for the loss of hydraulics and remote springs, now banned in the new regulations. Hopefully, you will also see that we have taken another step with how tightly packaged the sidepods and engine cover are. To get to this is not just a shrink-wrapping exercise but requires a huge amount of redesign and simulation to make it work,” continued Mike Elliott.
One striking difference on the 2022 cars will be new 18-inch wheels, replacing the previous 13-inch rims. Their impact on racing remains to be seen but the early signs are positive.
“What we have seen in testing, particularly the Abu Dhabi test at the end of 2021, is that there are subtle differences. It is going to change what we want to do with set-up, but it is a step in the right direction as I think the tyre will help improve the racing, won’t overheat as much and will be easier to manage,” noted Mike Elliott.
Another crucial element the engineers have had to contend with in the development of the 2022 car is the freezing of certain components which are now locked in for several years, including the gearbox and Power Unit. The stakes for getting both components as strong as can be, while maintaining reliability, have rarely been higher."
Red Bull Racing RB18,"After a very close battle, Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen won the 2021 World Drivers' Championship, breaking a seven-year Mercedes-Benz stronghold. For the Milton Keynes based team there was little time to celebrate as a brand new set of regulations came into effect at the start of the 2022 season.
The most crucial changes focus on aerodynamics with the regulations banning complex devices like the barge boards and reintroducing ground-effect tunnels. The reasoning behind this was to make it easier to closely follow the car ahead and then make a pass. Lead by Adrian Newey, the Red Bull Racing engineers developed the RB18 to meet these revised regulations.
In modern Formula 1 design, aerodynamics is crucial to the extent that they even dictate the design of the mechanical components. This prompted Red Bull Racing to revert to pull-rod rear suspension from the previous generation of cars; a solution then followed by all other teams. To get a clean airflow through the new ground-effect tunnels, Newey opted to switch things around and run pull-rods at the front and push-rods at the back for the RB18.
The packaging of the cooling elements was also changed to allow for a remarkable 'undercut' beneath the side-pods, which featured relatively small radiator openings. This was done to allow air to flow around the car back to the new aerodynamic elements attached to the rear of the floor. To ensure the engine did get enough cooling, a larger intake was fitted behind the driver.
Before the successful 2021 campaign, engine supplier Honda announced the company would withdraw from the sport at the end of the season. To ensure a steady engine supply, Honda and Red Bull Racing have set up a new partnership that will allow the Austrian team to continue running the Japanese power unit but under their own name. A freeze in the engine regulations will ensure that the hybrid-V6s will remain competitive for several more years.
The radical RB18 broke cover at the first of two official tests, at Barcelona, and will be raced by defending World Champion Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez."
Williams FW44 Mercedes,"Williams Racing is proud to reveal the livery that will adorn the FW44, the team’s vibrant new challenger for the 2022 FIA Formula One season. The design, featuring a contrasting diamond shape and flashes of red and blue, embodies the exciting new era of the Williams brand, whilst still retaining the classic team spirit.
Designed in line with the 2022 Formula One regulations implemented to encourage closer racing, the FW44 features aerodynamic modifications; including over-wheel winglets and wheel covers, 18” low profile Pirelli tyres and rolled tip rear wings. The new identity also sees changes to the front wing and nose, as well as underfloor tunnels that will allow cars to create efficient downforce through ground effect. The 2022 power unit will run on a more sustainable fuel, and the new and improved cars will also have greater safety features.
Jost Capito, CEO & Team Principal: “Over its history as an iconic Formula One team, Williams Racing has shown great strength and sophistication. The new visual identity of the 2022 car perfectly encapsulates these characteristics that the staff, drivers and fans have demonstrated time and time again. As we move into the new era of our sport, the FW44 highlights the transition to the future, as well as acknowledging the timeless qualities that make us who we are. Last season we were thrilled and proud to make such strong advancements as a team, with a number of well-earned points-scoring results in addition to a podium. Looking forward, we want to build on this success, and the FW44 perfectly embodies these ambitions to return to the front of the grid. I look forward to witnessing this progression with Nicholas and Alex at the helm.”
Nicholas Latifi: “I’m a fan of the new livery. Keeping the blue was important as it’s synonymous with Williams Racing, but it’s a pattern we’ve not seen before and the fluorescent red will pop on track which I really like. It’s a fresh new look to start off the new era of F1. I’m super excited for testing in Barcelona, to get back behind the wheel, push and see what the car can do. Pre-season always feels like quite a long time, but it’s been really busy and there’s been a nice build-up at the factory with lots of hard work from everyone. The new regulations should allow for much better racing so I’m excited for the challenge and we will aim to gather some good data from testing, to take us into the first few races.”
Alex Albon: ""The FW44 livery is clean and simple. I like that we’ve gone for more blue with the dynamic diamond finish and a little bit of red; it looks really good and I’m looking forward to seeing it out on track. The upcoming Barcelona track session will be about making sure we’re efficient with our time to best ensure we have a competitive package heading into the season. We don’t have many days before our first race and so we quickly need to understand which areas of the car are strong and where we need to make improvements. I’m sure it will be a little bit of a learning curve as we all try to learn how to get the most out of the new regulations, but the objectives and the way that we focus on this car is very much the same as in previous years. Ultimately, we’re all still trying to get a racing car around a track as quickly as possible."""
Alfa Romeo Racing C41 Ferrari,"The C41, the latest contender created by Sauber Motorsport, which manages and operates the Alfa Romeo Racing ORLEN team in the Formula One championship, saw the light in Warsaw just minutes after noon.
A spectacular ceremony in the impressive setting of the Grand Theatre, in Poland’s capital city, saw the attendance of a limited number of senior team personnel – with media, fans and team employees being invited to watch virtually in respect of the local Covid regulations. Team drivers, Kimi Räikkönen and Antonio Giovinazzi, and reserve driver, Robert Kubica, entered the stage as the C41, in a striking new livery, was revealed in all its glory.
Featuring a novel colour scheme, designed by Alfa Romeo’s Centro Stile and featuring the now traditional red and white colours of the team, the car, designed under the coordination of Technical Director, Jan Monchaux, represents an evolution of the C39 that competed in the 2020 season. Owing to the restrictions imposed by the regulations, the car carries over many of the components of its predecessor, while still striking with its renewed appearance, in particular in regard to the nosecone, an area on which the team chose to focus its development tokens. Under the bodywork, a new Ferrari engine lies in wait, ready to roar in less than a week, when the team embarks onto a new season with the C41’s shakedown in Barcelona on Friday.
Co-Title partner, ORLEN, features prominently on the bodywork, retaining its position on the sidepods, on the Halo and on the rear wing; the Alfa Romeo logo, featuring the Visconti snake-and-cross crest, is flanked by the Quadrifoglio – four-leaf clover – traditionally associated with Alfa Romeo’s racing efforts, and the logo of Autodelta, the brand’s legendary competition department. The logos of returning and new partners adorn the bodywork, contributing to the creation of one of the standout cars on the grid – a classic design that embodies the passion and tradition of the marques it represents.
Having unveiled its latest creation, the focus of the team now switches to the car’s shakedown and the crucial three days of pre-season testing in the desert setting of Sakhir (March 12-14). This year’s reduced testing session in Bahrain will represent the sole chance for the team to fine-tune its product ahead of the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix."
AlphaTauri AT02 Honda,"Scuderia AlphaTauri has unveiled its 2021 car – the AT02 – in an all-new matte blue and white livery, alongside its drivers Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda. The launch – held at AlphaTauri’s new showroom in Salzburg, Austria, and presented digitally – saw Red Bull’s premium fashion brand model its Autumn/Winter 2021 collection together with the team’s new-look for the upcoming 2021 Formula 1 season.
After a successful first season racing in the AlphaTauri colours, the Italian outfit is looking to challenge the top of the ultra-competitive midfield in 2021, putting its faith in the new pairing. Since debuting with the team in 2017, Gasly has earned two F1 podiums – including a spectacular maiden win at Monza in 2020 – meaning his experience with the team will allow him to step-up to a team leader role. Joining the Frenchman will be 20-year-old Tsunoda, the first Japanese driver to race in F1 since 2014. His promotion to F1 comes off the back of a fast, four-season trajectory; from winning the 2018 F4 Japanese Championship and finishing third in the 2020 FIA F2 Championship to entering the top-level ranks this year. Expectations are high for his rapid style of learning to complement the experience of Gasly.
“The decision to go for Pierre and Yuki in 2021 was taken because Scuderia AlphaTauri’s philosophy is still to give talented young drivers from the Red Bull Junior Program the opportunity to step up to F1 and to educate them – this is why Yuki now gets his chance,” explained Team Principal, Franz Tost. “With Pierre on Yuki’s side we have an experienced driver, who can help our Japanese rookie to develop faster, but at the same time we can aim for good results. I think this pair is the best possible scenario to achieve both our targets, and I’m also confident this will be a successful one.”
In 2020, Scuderia AlphaTauri won best livery by a landslide, and the team’s new racecar livery took centre stage with the drivers at the fashion event, anticipating the 2021 model that will debut on track at pre-season testing in Bahrain. The test is the precursor to an unprecedented 23-race schedule, and in preparation for the demanding calendar both drivers have spent time at Red Bull’s Athlete Performance Center for intense fitness testing. “I’m ready to take on the role of team leader. Yuki is a very quick driver, and he will help us move the team forward – we will work together to achieve that,” said Pierre Gasly, the team’s all-time top points scorer. “I really believe last year was the team’s best in terms of the way it worked, the development, the performance and the way it managed the race weekends. I’m always hungry for more, and I’m sure we can achieve great things in 2021.”
Yuki Tsunoda, who was honoured with the Anthoine Hubert Award for best Formula 2 rookie in 2020, added, “I’ve been lucky enough to spend some time with Scuderia AlphaTauri ahead of the season, so I’m already developing strong relationships and learning a lot from them – including Pierre, who is an incredible talent. My main goal is to learn quickly and deliver results as soon as possible, and I’m really excited to get started.”
The launch at AlphaTauri headquarters not only gave Gasly and Tsunoda a preview of the AlphaTauri Autumn/Winter 2021 fashion collection, but the drivers had the chance to select their new off-grid look ahead of the season start. Ahmet Mercan, CEO AlphaTauri, summarized: “This is a triple reveal at a unique point of time: a new AlphaTauri Showroom where fashion meets F1, a first look at the AW21 AlphaTauri collection and the unveiling of the new Scuderia AlphaTauri F1 livery and driver pairing.”
Scuderia AlphaTauri fans don’t have long to wait for racing action: The Formula 1 season kicks off at the Bahrain Test, 12 – 14 March, getting ready for the first round, the Bahrain Grand Prix on 28 March."
Alpine A521 Renault,"The first Renault-backed Formula 1 car developed was the un-raced Alpine A500 of 1976. By the time, the car was sufficiently developed to hit the track, it had been renamed the Renault R.S. 01. Over forty years later, the company has come full circle and from 2021 season onwards, the former Renault team will race under the Alpine F1 banner.
The Renault sports car subsidiary will make it is long delayed Formula 1 debuted with the A521. As per the special COVID-19 influenced regulations, it is a developed of the car raced as a Renault in 2020. In an effort to safe costs, each team was handed a pair of development tokens that could be used to make improvements where this was deemed most useful. Further complicating things were changes to the rules affecting the aerodynamics, which were designed to slow the cars down.
The Alpine team used the tokens to make up for the downforce lost due to the regulation changes. In an effort to clean up the airflow to the all-important rear diffuser, some of the cooling architecture was relocated from the side-pods to the area above and behind the engine. Such are the aero benefits of the ever smaller side-pods that the higher centre of gravity was of little concern. Another change was a bulkier air-box that with some imagination could bring back fond memories of the Ligier JS5 of the 1970s.
For the 2021 season, the Alpine F1 Team will use the services of Esteban Ocon, who already raced for Renault in 2020 and double World Champion Fernando Alonso, who in the past had been successful for the Renault team in two separate stints."
Aston Martin AMR21 Mercedes,"Aston Martin is back at the pinnacle of global motorsport after the Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team proudly revealed its 2021 FIA Formula One™ World Championship contender on Wednesday. The stunning new AMR21 heralds the beginning of a truly significant chapter in the 108-year history of the brand, and carries the hopes of racing fans around the globe ahead of its debut in the Bahrain Grand Prix later this month.
The new Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team car returns the British ultra-luxury marque to the pinnacle of world motorsport for the first time in more than 60 years. It was unveiled today, in a much anticipated immersive virtual launch in front of a global audience. Described by Aston Martin Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll as an ‘important event in automotive history’, the new contender will be the first works Formula 1 car to carry the famous wings since Maurice Trintignant’s DBR5 crossed the finish line at Silverstone in 1960.
The AMR21, to be raced this season by four-time F1™ World Champion Sebastian Vettel (DE) and rising star Lance Stroll (CA), carries a striking Aston Martin Racing Green livery in recognition of Aston Martin’s traditional racing colours and glorious sporting legacy. It is also bedecked by a host of global partners, led by American IT giant Cognizant, while the chassis features a magenta stripe down the side in reference to the team’s longstanding partner BWT.
Today’s event also threw the spotlight on an energizing shift within Aston Martin as the team is set to become the global showcase for the brand’s engineering and performance capabilities. Indeed a new 200,000 square-foot facility will complement the existing Aston Martin F1™ factory at Silverstone when completed in the second half of 2022, and the team is well positioned to become an innovation lab to drive forward the brand’s future road car technologies. These will include the suite of mid-engined sportscars, inspired by the Aston Martin Valkyrie, which will become central to the product portfolio through the next decade.
It may have been absent from F1™ for 61 years, but Aston Martin’s competitive credentials are firmly intact – the company was formed by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford in 1913 with motorsport at the heart of its endeavour. Next year will mark a century since Aston Martin made its grand prix debut (in France 1922), and the brand has enjoyed sustained success in sportscar racing, including overall victory in the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans. Most recently Aston Martin became a double class winner with the Vantage GTE in last year’s race at La Sarthe and is the reigning GT FIA World Endurance Manufacturers’ champion.
The Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team also boasts a strong bloodline, building on the foundations of Team Silverstone, which in its various guises has won five grands prix, and is coming off the back of a race-winning campaign as the Racing Point Formula One™ Team, having been revitalized under the leadership of Lawrence Stroll and Team Principal and CEO Otmar Szafnauer.
The new AMR21, powered by a turbo-charged Mercedes-AMG F1 M12 E Performance engine with hybrid energy recovery, will run for the first time at Silverstone during a promotional day on 4 March, 2021, before embarking on a full test programme at Bahrain on 12-14 March.
Executive Chairman, Aston Martin Lagonda, Lawrence Stroll said: “I’ve dreamed about this day for a very long time. I’ve always been a car guy and I’ve always loved racing, too. My first dream was to own a Formula One™ team. My second dream was to acquire a significant shareholding in Aston Martin Lagonda. Today is about the merging of those two dreams. So, as I say, today is all about dreams, and it shows that dreams really can come true, in the shape of our new AMR21.
“Aston Martin returning to Formula One™ after an absence of 61 years will have a powerful effect on the sport, the media and the fans, commanding global attention.
“The team who designed and built our new Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ car – the 500 men and women who conceive, manufacture, build and prepare our cars so that we can go racing at the pinnacle of global motorsport – has always punched above its weight. Now, as the Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team, it has the power with which to punch even harder.
“This is just the beginning. The team is pushing forward, and our ambitions are limitless. We now have the pieces in place, the people and the partners, to make real progress.
“The launch of the new AMR21 is also the celebration of a new beginning for Aston Martin. Today’s transformational event has given us the opportunity to communicate the evolution of the iconic Aston Martin Wings logo for only the 12th time in the company’s 108-year history. The Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ car is our group’s highest expression of performance, innovation, engineering quality, attention to detail, and teamwork. For that reason, it’s natural that our new logo should make its debut on our new Formula One™ car.”
Chief Executive Officer, Aston Martin Lagonda, Tobias Moers said: “Today is a truly historic moment for Aston Martin, as we return to the pinnacle of motorsport for the first time in more than 60 years. The Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team will have far-reaching positive effects on the Aston Martin brand, our culture, and the design and technology of Aston Martin road cars. Our return to Formula One™ will positively and profoundly affect every employee and foremost our customer journey all over the world; and will help us bring a focused, agile Formula One™ way of thinking to the whole Aston Martin business.
“Indeed, the Formula One™ team will become a dynamic and exciting innovation lab to drive forward future Aston Martin road car technologies and performance, which will truly differentiate our cars in the coming years. Aston Martin has always made beautiful cars. Now, as we begin a new era of Aston Martin in Formula One™, we’ll bring more innovation and more performance.”"
Ferrari SF21,"Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow’s SF21 car that will race this season, was seen for the first time and features a subtle livery that looks to the challenges of the future without forgetting the team’s roots and history. “The rear end is reminiscent of the burgundy red of the very first Ferrari, the 125 S,” explained Team Principal Mattia Binotto. “But as it moves gradually towards the cockpit area, it transforms into the modern red that we have used in most recent years. This season presents us with many challenges and through this livery, visually, we reboot from our past and head into the future.”
The car. This car is the 67th to be built in Maranello to compete in the Formula 1 World Championship and is an evolution of last year’s SF1000, as dictated by the regulations, which require the use of the same chassis as in 2020, thus limiting the opportunities for change in many areas. Therefore, the SF21 was developed in all the permitted areas, from the engine, which is completely new, to the aerodynamics and, at the rear end, which is where the two development tokens allowed in the regulations have been used.
Line-up. The SF21 makes its track debut tomorrow in Bahrain for a Filming Day, during which it can complete up to 100 kilometres for the purpose of acquiring film footage for team partners and media use. The Scuderia’s youngest driver line-up since 1968, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, will both drive. When the first race of the season takes place on 28 March, the pairing’s average age will be 25 years and 3 days. Before that, they will tackle the only 2021 pre-season test, getting to grips with the new car over three days at the Sakhir circuit."
Haas VF-21 Ferrari,"Following a successful 2018 season, which saw the Haas F1 Team finish fifth in the constructor's championship, the American team slipped down the order. In 2020, only three points were scored compared to the 93 earned just two seasons earlier. Much of the same was expected during the 2021 season as the regulations limited the development work to just two changes to keep the costs down before the all-new rules will come in effect at the start of the 2022 season.
The Haas F1 Team assessed the situation and decided to spend the precious resources on developing the new-for-2022 cars. Neither of the tokens available to upgrade the VF-20 were actually used when the 2021 specification VF-21 was created. The work focused only on the meeting the revised aerodynamic regulations. That included a new, tapered floor and less complicated barge boards.
Further hedging their bet, the team decided to sign two rookie drivers, Mick Schumacher and Nikita Mazepin. Not surprisingly, the two Haas VF-21s proved slowest of the lot during the opening race at Bahrain."
McLaren MCL35M Mercedes,"The first Formula 1 of 2021 to break cover is the McLaren MCL35M. As the name suggests, it is an evolution of the car used in the 2020 season but with a crucial change in the engine department. Instead of running the Renault power unit used during the three previous seasons, McLaren have come full circle in 2021 and returned to the Mercedes-Benz fray.
The reason why the 2021 McLaren is still only a variation of the existing design is due to the regulations. As a result of the global pandemic, the sport agreed to limit the development for the new season with a token system. As McLaren had already agreed to switch engine suppliers before the pandemic, it was forced to used most of the tokens available to accommodate for the different power unit.
While built to the same regulations, the two engines are actually quite different, especially from a packaging perspective. Where Renault use a conventional turbocharger, the Mercedes-AMG power-unit has a split turbo. The turbine is mounted behind the engine and is connected to a separate compressor at the front of the V6 through a shaft. This configuration allows for a larger compressor and is one of the reasons why the British-built German engine has been so successful.
With the compressor mounted ahead of the engine, it had to be installed slightly further away from the monocoque chassis that was carried over from 2020 as per the regulations. This may have made the MCL35M slightly longer than its predecessor. Changes to the cooling arrangements will have had effects on the aerodynamics. As has a rule change, which calls for a simpler floor that is tapered to the rear.
In addition to a new engine, there is also a change in the cockpit as the team managed to sign multiple Grand Prix winning driver Daniel Ricciardo to join Lando Norris. Despite all the changes, the McLaren team got off to a great start to the 2021 season with both cars finishing in the points at each of the first four rounds of the World Championship. Norris scored a podium finish by placing third in the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola in the MCL35M's second outing.
For round five, the Monaco Grand Prix, the McLaren team revealed a one-off livery, bringing the legendary Gulf colours back to the sport."
Mercedes-Benz W12 E Performance,"Since the introduction of the full hybrid regulations in 2014, Mercedes-Benz have managed to maintain their advantage. During this period, the rules changed only subtly, which helped the German owned team to keep an edge. This looked set to continue in the 2021 season, which saw the development limited to two 'tokens' following the Covid-19 pandemic affected 2020 season. In addition to the two component changes allowed, there were also a change in the aerodynamic regulations. Working within these parameters, Mercedes-Benz produced an evolution of the 2020 World Championship winning W11, dubbed the W12 E Performance.
Carried over from the 2020 car was the monocoque chassis and the gearbox. Changes were made to the engine, which included a new plenum and revised turbocharger to cure some of the reliability issues that affected the power unit during the 2020 season. A new aluminium alloy was also used for the engine block for the same reason. The regulation changes focused on the floor and the bargeboards. Both areas are made simpler to reduce the level of downforce produced. Further changes included a bulge on the bodywork to clear the new plenum.
Despite the limited changes to the regulations, the Mercedes-Benz team seemed to have lossed its edge at the official three-day, pre-season test. The regulation changes clearly affected the areas where the Mercedes-Benz was particularly strong. The rivalling Red Bull team also benefited from a much improved Honda power unit, which truly seemed to have levelled the playing field. The Mercedes-Benz engineers spent the short few weeks before the first race to get back on par.
In practice and qualifying, Red Bull Racing still had an edge with Max Verstappen clinching pole position. In a particular close race, and with the help of a bold strategy, Mercedes-Benz driver Lewis Hamilton managed to snatch the victory, restoring the order for at least one more race."
Red Bull Racing RB16B Honda,"For the 2021 Formula 1 World Championship, the teams are limited to the number of changes can be made to the 2020 designs that have to be carried over. This is a special regulation to off-set some of the revenue losses caused by the global pandemic. Accordingly, Red Bull Racing opted to their new-for-2021 racer the RB16B.
In the handful of images released of the RB16B ahead of the official test scheduled for March in Bahrain, it is clear that most of the available upgrade tokens were spent on revising the geometry of the rear suspension. As always, Red Bull Racing keeps their cards close to their chest, so further changes to the car expected before it takes part in the first official session.
Powering the RB16B is the latest evolution Honda's V6 hybrid engine. It is the final year that the Japanese company is the official engine supplier and as such, it has brought forward all upgrades that had originally been postponed to the 2022 season due to the corona pandemic. In record speed, the power unit has been further improved with the hope of making the final step up to performance level of the Mercedes-Benz engine.
For the 2021 season, driver Max Verstappen is joined by Checo Perez. The driving pairing first hit the track during the official three-day, pre-season test at Bahrain. The new RB16B was impressive, racking up as massive amount of laps and setting the fastest time."
Williams FW43B Mercedes,"Williams Racing proudly launches its 2021 Formula One challenger, the Williams Mercedes FW43B, featuring a striking new livery for the season ahead. The team’s new look captures the spirit of the team’s past, the present transformation and its drive to future ambitions as it heads into its first full season of ownership under US based Investment company, Dorilton Capital.
Whilst evolutionary on the technical side due to the regulations, hence the designation FW43B as opposed to the FW44, the 2021 car will race with a dramatic new visual identity sporting a livery inspired by Williams’ all-conquering cars of the 1980s and 1990s, combining blues, white and yellow accents.
Speaking for the first time as CEO of Williams Racing, Jost Capito said: “Williams Racing is a sporting icon, and a team that has forged a reputation of success through sheer determination and grit intertwined with innovation, passionate and skilful race-craft and an absolute desire to win. Highs and lows are typical in any long-established sporting brand’s journey and historic success can be a strong motivator, but it cannot be relied upon to define future success in the modern era of Formula One.
“Therefore, we have created a fresh new livery for the 2021 car; one that acknowledges our incredible past and retains the spirit, drive and motivation that remains at the core of Williams’ DNA yet looks to the future and signposts our long-term ambition to return to the front of the grid. Whilst we are just starting out on this journey and there is still a lot of work to do, we are happy to see momentum in the right direction and look forward to continuing that progress on track this season.”"
